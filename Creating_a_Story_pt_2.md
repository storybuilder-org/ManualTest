### Creating a Story pt 2 ###
After a break, we decide to continue refining our story idea.  Launch StoryBuilder again.  From the empty Story Overview form, you need to reload the "Danger Calls" outline.  Select the File menu: <br/>

You could select the Open sub-menu entry, which would open a dialog box similar to what we used to save our file.  However, there's also a shortcut: StoryBuilder keeps the last three files you worked on in a list towards the bottom of the menu.  Click on the DANGER.STB file as a fast way of saying you want to load this file.   <br/>

You can work on multiple story outlines in one StoryBuilder session, but StoryBuilder can only work with one story outline at a time.  This is either the outline you've most recently opened, or a new outline which hasn't yet been saved as a file and given a filename.  The New option on the File menu will clear the story outline that's been loaded (prompting you to save first, of course), in order to create a new file.   <br/>

At this point we've recorded the initial story idea.  However, there's a great gulf between a story idea and a finished story.  At rare intervals, a story idea may spring forth so complete and well formed that it practically writes itself.  Most ideas, though, are fragments--- a scene, a character, a situation (like this one), an ending, or something else.  What we need to do now is to convert this fragment, this idea, into a concept. <br/>

A concept is complete and ready to write: you know who the main characters are, what their problems are, and what the outcome of those problems will be.  The characters are fleshed out,  you know where the action will take place, and you know what that action is (the plot.)  You have a story.  Converting story ideas into story concepts is what StoryBuilder is all about. <br/>

We could start work on the "Danger Calls" concept from any direction: setting, plot, etc.  Let's start with the characters.  As a 'cops and robbers' story, two characters are obvious, the cop and the robber.  Select the Character form by clicking on the Character menu.  You'll see a blank form that looks like this: <br/>

Click on the Add Character button on the bottom of the form to add a character to the story outline.  You'll see 'Character 01' added to the list of characters on the left side of the form.   <br/>
The Problem, Setting, and Plot forms in StoryBuilder all have a layout similar to the Character form.  There's a list on the left side of the form which displays a label for each  problem, location, plot point, or, in the case of the Character form, for each character in the story.  The right side of the form is a series of tab cards which contain information about one of the characters (or problems, or settings, or plot points.)   <br/>

When you add a character by clicking on the Add Character button, StoryBuilder will add a new character with a default label like 'Character 01'.  When you key in the character's first and/or last name in the provided elements at the top of the tabs on the right, and press enter or tab to a different element, the 'Character 01' will be replaced with  the character's name. <br/>
Let's give our character a name and role. <br/>

StoryBuilder has tools to help you in naming your character, but for now let's not worry about how we assigned the name and just key it in.   <br/>

The Role field lists some possible roles.  The character we've just added will be our detective.  Scanning through the list, Detective was selected.    <br/>

 We will also add a second character, the bad guy, the same way: click on the Add Character button, key in the name, Charlie Lacas, and press enter. <br/>

Notice that the list of roles doesn't have an entry for Drug Dealer, so this was just keyed in.  Most StoryBuilder controls have lists of possible entries, but these lists are intended to be suggestions, not limitations.  You can key whatever you want into most of these fields. <br/>

StoryBuilder also allows you to modify many of these lists of values.  See "Customizing StoryBuilder" for details. <br/>
