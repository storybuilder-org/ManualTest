# Navigating in StoryCAD

Your outline is a tree of story elements, which are displayed in the Navigation Pane. Here's how to move around in this visual tree, and within a story element, and how to edit properties on a story element.

Adding and removing story elements can be done either from the menu bar's Add button or via a flyout panel from the Navigation Pane.
