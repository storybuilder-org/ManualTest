act: A major division of a play or opera.  Subdivisions of acts are called scenes or episodes. <br/>

action: The events which unfold in a story and which answer the question  'What happens next?'  Action comes from characters who do things in order to achieve their goals or overcome obstacles. <br/>

ambiance: The mood or tone of a situation. <br/>

anima: The inner personality of a character.  See 'persona'.  A term from Jungian psychology. <br/>

archetype: A model or pattern with  symbolic significance which recurs throughout literature. <br/>

C <br/>

catastrophe: A misfortune or disaster, usually sudden.   A plot in which events result in an outcome not in line with the protagonist's goals. <br/>

catharsis: The purging of emotions.  Aristotle wrote that the effect of tragedy upon the audience  is a purification of the spirit through the discharge of emotions, with the resulting relief from tension. <br/>

cause and effect: In stories, events must have a reason, rather than occur through coincidence.  Causes are usually the actions of characters, and are based on motives. <br/>

chapter: A main division of a book, usually numbered, but sometimes titled. Since you don't want the reader to quit reading, arrange your chapter breaks so that chapters end at places of high dramatic tension. <br/>

character: A person represented in a story.  Character is the sum of the traits and features which distinguish one person from another; the storyteller creates character by selecting these qualities. <br/>

climax: The point of maximum dramatic intensity which occurs at a turning point or crisis. <br/>

coincidence: An event which occurs through random chance.  Readers don't often accept coincidence in fiction, but demand cause and effect. <br/>

comedy: A story of light and cheerful tone with a happy ending. <br/>

conflict: The struggle between opposing forces.  Conflict is the force which drives the events which comprise the plot. <br/>

counterplot: A subplot  in a story which contrasts to the principal plot line.  For example, scenes which depict the antagonist's actions can be a counterplot. <br/>

crisis: A turning point in a story, at which a choice or change or decision must occur.  Climax refers to the emotional intensity a crisis should generate. <br/>

D <br/>

denouement: The final outcome or unravelling of the complications in a story.  The falling action which follows the final climax. <br/>

details: Specific and particular items or features.  Effective stories rely on details rather than generalizations, particularly in characterization, settings, and props. <br/>

deus ex machina: Using an improbable or supernatural force  at the end of a story to resolve the complications of the plot.  Such devices are no longer accepted by most audiences.  The term is Latin for 'god from a machine.' <br/>

dilemma: A choice between undesirable alternatives.  Effective conflicts in a story should be dilemmas; if the choice is obvious, the character's path is clear, and suspense is weakened. <br/>

drama: (1) Events which have vivid, conflicting elements.  (2) A literary composition which tells a story about characters in conflict. <br/>

dramatis personae: A list of the characters in a story and their relationships or roles.  Printed in the program of a play or at the beginning of a literary work. <br/>

E <br/>

empathy: Identifying with or experiencing the sensations and emotions of another person.   A major goal of fiction is to invoke from the reader empathy for the characters  in the story. <br/>

F <br/>

fiction: A literary work created from imagination and designed to entertain the reader.  'Effective fiction makes readers think, but the primary purpose of all fiction is to make readers feel.' --- H. Shaw. <br/>

foreshadowing: Writing events into a story which foretell a later event, so that when the later event occurs, it will have more impact or seem more believable. <br/>

foreshortened prose: Contracted or abridged narration which summarizes  story events or scenes.  Foreshortened prose can compress large stretches of time into a few words,  but is less graphic and compelling than writing in scenes. <br/>

formula: A plot created according to stereotyped or set forms.  Most stories follow a formula at a base level.  Good stories transcend formula through attention to  detail and complexity of characterization, motive, situation, and setting.. <br/>
