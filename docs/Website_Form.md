These buttons allow you to refresh, go forwards and respectively. <br/>

This is the search bar, if you have a website link (URL) then you can paste it here and 		after clicking the search button it will load the website. Conversely if you don’t have a 		URL you can search a query such as a map of the world and it will search it using  <br/>
Google. <br/>

Example -  Planning out a fictional character. <br/>

1) Create a new website node, you can do this by right clicking a node and  then clicking then clicking the webpage icon. <br/>

Congrats, we have now got a map our fictional word and can start planning our story 		around this world <br/>

Note: The Website Form requires the Microsoft Edge WebView 2 runtime, most 				Windows computers will already have this installed by default however if you are for 		any reason missing it, StoryCAD will ask to automatically install it. <br/>
