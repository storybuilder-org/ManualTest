### Concept Tab ###

A concept is an idea that asks a question that implies conflict.  The answer to that question is your story.   <br/>

Concept is what begins to shape your idea into a story. Taking the time to create a compelling concept is key to a good story.  <br/>

Initially, phrase your concept as a "what if" question. Then use ‘What if? And ‘What happens is’ to flesh out your idea.  <br/>

A good concept sparks more “what if” questions. <br/>
