Getting Help <br/>

We suggest you first use this manual to try to find the information you’re looking for. <br/>

[The StoryBuilder Discord Server](https://discord.gg/g7jjtgBKsQ) contains a ‘frequently-asked-questions’ channel, and a ‘writers-chat’ channel. <br/>

Currently StoryCAD’s only direct support mechanism is to email support@storybuilder.org. <br/>

We plan to provide an on-line help request form as soon as possible. <br/>

Please write us with ideas or suggestions for improvements.  We want to make StoryCAD the best possible tool to help you achieve your fiction writing goals. <br/>
