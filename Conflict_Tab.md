 <br/>
The Conflict tab helps define the drama in a scene. <br/>

 <br/>
A scene is a 'small story', which has the same key elements of the overall story: a goal,  opposition to that goal, and an outcome.  The Conflict tab compresses the elements on the Problem form into a single tab. <br/>
 <br/>
Protagonist and Antagonist <br/>
These roles are selected from the list of characters defined on the Characters form. <br/>
 <br/>
Feelings <br/>
Motive is modified, at the scene level, into an emotional response which is specific to the character and the scenic action.  This control lists some common emotions. <br/>
 <br/>
Goal <br/>
The goal is the character's purpose or objective. <br/>
 <br/>
Opposition <br/>
The nature of the resistance to the Protagonist's goal. <br/>
 <br/>
Outcome <br/>
The result of the scene, from the Protagonist's point of view.  Most scenes should end in a disaster or failure to reach the scene's goal, lest the story end too easily. <br/>
 <br/>
The Dramatic Situations tool on the Plotting Aids subâ€‘  menu of the Tools  menu can help to define a scene's conflict, and works with the Conflict tab. <br/>
