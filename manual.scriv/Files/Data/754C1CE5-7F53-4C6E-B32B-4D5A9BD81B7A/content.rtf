\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The short definition for a story is }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 trouble}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 .  Like people, stories are at their best when things are at their worst. }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 You create a problem by devising a goal for  one of your story's characters, the Protagonist, and a motive which propels him or her to strive for the goal. You next define conflict: an opponent , the Antagonist,  who tries to  prevent the protagonist from reaching his or her goal.  The conflict leaves the outcome uncertain, which keeps the reader turning pages to find out what happens.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 A problem resolves in one of two ways: successfully or not. Both have their place in fiction. If the main story problem has a good outcome,  the story has a happy ending; if it\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s a bad outcome, the story\u8217\'92s a tragedy. Other problems\u8217\'92 bad outcomes represent setbacks for the protagonist, whereas good outcomes represent progress towards her story goal. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The protagonist may not initially be aware of his need (this is common in stories of discovery). The antagonist may not even be human, but a force or process or situation. But all problems have the elements of goal, motivation, and }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 conflict.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 A story can and usually will have multiple problems, but only one of them is the main story problem. When your protagonist resolves that problem, the story ends. The other problems in the story (subplots, complications, and sequences) must relate and contribute to the story problem, or they don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t belong in this story.\line }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It should be pointed out that even scenes, with their conflicts, present problems to be solved. You can think of stories as a kind of recursion, with a hierarchy of problems, down to the scene level.}
