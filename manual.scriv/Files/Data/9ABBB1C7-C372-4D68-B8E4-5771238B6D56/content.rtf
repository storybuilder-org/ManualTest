\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Let's start with Charlie Lacas.  We know a few things about him.  He's young, he deals drugs, and he uses technology that the detectives don't have.  That absence of technology suggests that the story doesn't take place in a big city.  But perhaps Charlie is a city boy who's figured out that he can use his supplier contacts in New York to deal drugs in a smaller city, say in upstate New York somewhere.   It's safer, the competition is less, and he has an edge over the small-town cops.   This implies that he's fairly bright, which makes him a more worthy adversary for our detectives.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The goal of all of this is to create a fully rounded human being, one who is believable and who you can visualize talking and acting in your story. }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The other major consideration is that the character should support the role you've given him.  Had the initial story idea been for a character, you might have fleshed the character out before you started looking for story problems, and then looked for a role to fit the character, but in this case the role came first and the character should fit the part.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 There's always a question of how much detail to provide, for characters, problems, settings, etc.  The answer will vary from story to story.  For example, this is an action-oriented story, so the characterizations aren't quite as important.  Whether or not they make it to your writing, the more you know about your characters the better.}
