Your goal, in following a template story structure like the ones the Master Plots tool provides, is to create scenes for your story that fit into the structure you\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92ve chosen, and to position them accordingly. The scenes you\u8217\'92ll use are what develops from your characters trying to solve their problems.}

The \u8216\'91He\u8217\'92s like a ghost\u8217\'92 scene, our Narrative Hook, also Introduces Characters- not all of them, but our protagonists, Leonard Kraskin and Tony Irwin, and, from a remove, our antagonist, Charlie Lacas. It also Presents a Problem to be Solved- \u8216\'91How will Leonard and Tony get past Charlie's tech?\u8217\'92, which is in fact a sub-problem of the Story Problem, \u8216\'91Catching the drug dealer Lacas\u8217\'92.

The MasterPlots tool was also used a second time, to copy a slightly different kind of story structure, a pattern of action- the Escape.

Clicking on this scene, we can make it our own by renaming it to 'Tony diverts Lacas by paging him and allows Leonard to escape\u8217\'92 and using our story Premise description.

The characters should be well defined, so that their actions are consistent with their natures.  The story problems should also be clearly understood, especially the resolutions.  Every problem is a story in miniature; plotting a story is largely a matter of arranging events from one or more problems into a satisfactory sequence.  But writing is a process of accumulation, and the ideas which you collect to create your story concept can come to you at any time.  If you visualize a scene.}
