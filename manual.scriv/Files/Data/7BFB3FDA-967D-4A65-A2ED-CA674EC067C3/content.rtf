\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i0 It\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92s useful to think about where this Problem fits in the overall story. The final conflict and its climax should not only be the highest tension (greatest conflict), but is (usually) where the protagonist solves his story problem, and is often a successful outcome. Problems which occur during the rising action (the story\u8217\'92s middle) will often have bad outcomes, but even if they appear to be successful, will lead to further complications. }
