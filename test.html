<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Writing fiction is tough. Modern novels typically contain between 70,000 and 100,000 words and can take a year or longer to write and edit. Starting a project of such magnitude without a plan is an invitation to disaster, but how do you plan something as complex as a novel?</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder is an outlining tool for fiction writers. The purpose of the outline is to manage complexity, a task made easier when you can visualize the structure of your story and individually address each of its many moving parts. The parts of good fiction are realistic, three dimensional characters who are engaged in meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic and suspenseful plots, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>and settings that appeal to the senses. You fill in the blanks to create these story elements.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder eliminates writer’s block by providing thousands of suggestions or examples for the details of story elements. A collection of tools assist you in creating conflicts, understanding your characters, and building your plot. StoryBuilder is designed to simplify the outlining process, inspire, and keep ideas flowing. Each story element has a list of key questions: a checklist to help you refine your work.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder’s layout provides a workflow to get you started, but you can work on any piece of your story at any time—add a scene, flesh out a character, or beef up a conflict. Whatever your story needs, for any form of fiction or any genre, StoryBuilder can help.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder frees your creativity and makes it fun. Mistakes in a StoryBuilder outline aren't costly; you don't fill your trash can with them. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>You're free to change and revise, to make mistakes, and to experiment.  </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">We hope you enjoy StoryBuilder and find it useful to your craft. </p>

<p class="ps13">Experienced computer users never underestimate the importance of a backup. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A power failure or computer crash, or a slip of the hand, can cost you the changes you've made since you last backed up your work.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The easiest and best backup is to save your work frequently at places where you're satisfied with your progress— milestones such as adding a plot point for an important scene, describing the physical appearance of a character, or figuring out how you plan to resolve a story problem. When you modify your outline, StoryBuilder will display a red pencil on the status bar to indicate that <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>it’s in an ‘unsaved’ state. Use the File | Save option to cause the outline to be re-written to disk.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Backups are written to the folder specified in the ‘Backup directory’ selection in Preferences. Use <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>the browse button next to the specified folder to select (or create) the folder you wish to keep your story outline backups in. We recommend creating a folder just for this purpose.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Backups are suffixed with a date timestamp, for example:</p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span></span></p>

<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">To revert to a backup, simply click on the .stbx file of your choice and use File | Save As to save it back where you want it. If you specify the same parent folder as your working outline, it’ll overlay it.</p>

<p class="ps51">Conflict<span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">        </span>The protagonist has a goal or objective, but something or someone (the antagonist) opposes the achievement of this goal. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The protagonist and the antagonist struggle until one or the other wins.</p>

<p class="ps51">Decision<span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">        </span>This problem pattern ends with the protagonist making a difficult and important decision. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The problem is a choice.</p>

<p class="ps51">Discovery<span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">         </span>The protagonist eventually makes a not too obvious discovery. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The discovery, which is the story's resolution, represents a change for him.<span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span></p>

<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The nature of the antagonism between protagonist and antagonist.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps53">Human vs. Nature <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">      </span>The protagonist eventually makes a not too obvious discovery. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The discovery, which is the story's resolution, represents a change for him.</p>
<p class="ps54"><br /></p>
<p class="ps53">Person vs. Person <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">       </span>The struggle may be two characters contending for the same prize, one person out to get another, or Odd Couple stories of characters with opposing traits, or ideological.</p>
<p class="ps54"><br /></p>
<p class="ps55">Person vs. Himself <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">     </span>The protagonist is his or her own antagonist. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The antagonistic side may be a destructive trait or habit, such as an addiction, or two opposing traits might fight for control in one soul.</p>
<p class="ps56"><br /></p>
<p class="ps57">Person vs. Society <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">      </span>...In the form of prejudices, taboos, or traditions.</p>
<p class="ps58"><br /></p>
<p class="ps57">Person vs. Situation <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">    </span>This is typical of Underdog master plot stories; the situation is an overpowering juggernaut such as a war, poverty, the 'system', or a corrupt organization.</p>
<p class="ps58"><br /></p>
<p class="ps57">Person vs. Fate <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">           </span>Fate (old age, death, evil, etc.) is usually personified or illustrated as a character.</p>
<p class="ps58"><br /></p>
<p class="ps57">Person vs. Machine <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">    </span>The Machine's role may be as a symbol (for example, of dehumanizing society).  <em><span class="s8">Pinocchio</span></em> and <em><span class="s8">Frankenstein</span></em> are the archetypes of Person vs. Machine stories.</p>
<p class="ps58"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The terms 'human' and 'person' in these labels means that these roles are humanized, not that they must be humans. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The protagonist can be a dog, a wooden puppet, or a hobbit, but the reader must be able to identify with the character's humanity.  </p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><strong><span class="s5">Subject</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">This control identifies the basic area or type of problem.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The Subject control lists many of the common types of problems encountered in fiction.  </p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The problem subject should be as specific as possible. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If you start with a generic subject from the list, make it unique. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Instead of 'Being Hunted', you might say 'Chased by Lieutenant Girard.'</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><strong><span class="s5">Story Question</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The primary reason your reader reads your story is to find out how it comes out, to find the answer to a question the story poses. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It's useful to clarify exactly what that question is.</p>
<p class="ps13">The story question can be framed as a yes or no question in terms of the protagonist's goal: 'Will Scarlett manage to save her plantation?', or 'How will Macbeth prove that his father was murdered?'</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Consider whether the reader should know the story's outcome prior to the climax scene. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In many character-oriented stories the answer should be yes, and the story's dramatic arc deals with how things happen rather than what will happen. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If the answer should be no, the story question is the essential suspense of the story, and your plot must serve to keep the outcome in doubt.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><strong><span class="s5">Source of Conflict</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">This control identifies the beginning or origin of the problem.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Think of the story as a flow from a state of equilibrium (the way things were before the action started), through a state of change (the story itself) to a new state of equilibrium (resulting from the story's resolution.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Source of Conflict identifies how the original equilibrium is shattered, and why a change is necessary.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The Source of Conflict is useful in identifying your story's point of attack, the opening scene.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The provided choices are generalized sources from which many problems spring. Be specific. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If you start with a generic source, replace it with one specific to your story and your protagonist. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Instead of <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>'Protagonist wants to change his situation'', say 'Joe wants to escape his poverty.'</p>

<p class="ps13">In real life, things sometimes just happen. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In fiction, with few exceptions, they happen <em><span class="s8">for a reason</span></em>. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Motivation should be closely related to the story's Outcome and to the Theme. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The clash of motives is the abstract counterpart to the concrete conflict between protagonist and antagonist, and provides thematic significance to the story.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Motivation is closely tied to character— it could be thought of as the place where character and plot meet. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The psychological and social factors, traits, back story, and the motivation of your character must all be consistent. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>Deep motives can only change as a result of character development or growth.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The list of provided motivations is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers many of those found in literature.</p>

<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><strong><span class="s5">Goal</span></strong></p>

<p class="ps13">The Goal is the result or end toward which the character's efforts are directed.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">As with all story elements, the more specific the goal, the better. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The Goal control lists a number of generic goals, which is certainly not a comprehensive list. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Even if one of these is selected, you should convert it into a specific desire: rather than 'To find a missing object', your goal should be 'To find the Maltese Falcon.'</p>

<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">On the other hand, don't hesitate to use negative traits such as vices or prejudices, base motives, or aspects of the Shadow archetype in casting your antagonist if the story calls for it.</p>

<p class="ps60"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">While we often think we’d like to live our lives with a minimum of conflict, we’re fascinated by the stuff, and our fiction absolutely depends on it.  </p>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">Conflict is easy to define: it’s what prevents your character from achieving his or her goal. Picking the right conflict is arguably the most important decision you’ll make in designing your story. If there’s no struggle, there’s no story. Robert McKee puts it this way: <em><span class="s8">Nothing moves forward in a story except through conflict.</span></em></p>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">Not all conflict will suit your needs. It’s easy to swing towards either of two directions. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>At the one extreme is senseless violence, with Black Bart villains and a need for your hero to wear tights and a cape. At the other lies the absence of meaningful conflict, replaced with shallow conflicts which are easily resolved and lead to Pollyanna outcomes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The right conflict adds complexity and layers of meaning to your story. </p>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps3">There are endless forms of conflict, but fortunately, there is a literature and practice that applies some order to it all: Conflict Resolution Theory. CR Theory has developed from third-party work on conflict resolution as practiced by mediators and legal authorities. These efforts are attempts to find peaceful resolutions to disputes. This is emphatically<strong><em><span class="s15"> </span></em></strong><em><span class="s8">not</span></em><strong><span class="s5">  </span></strong>your aim as a fiction writer, you want to <em><span class="s8">build</span></em> conflict, but CR Theory does provide a useful framework to examine conflict.</p>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps10"><strong><span class="s5">Conflict Categories</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps10">CR Theory generally classifies a conflict according to the five categories below -- <em><span class="s8">relationship, data, interest, structural and value.</span></em> Each has its own subcategories and, typically, examples of a conflict.</p>
<p class="ps10"><strong><span class="s5">Relationship Conflicts</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps10">Relationship conflicts occur because of negative behavior patterns by or both parties, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>strong negative emotions, misconceptions and stereotypes, and poor (or no) communication. They frequently involve pressure from other non-relationship issues (such as money) or third-parties. Relationship problems often follow a downward spiral of destructive actions. </p>
<p class="ps10"><strong><span class="s5">Data Conflicts</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps10">Data conflicts occur when people lack the information necessary to make good choices, are accidentally or intentionally misinformed, disagree on what data is important or how the data They frequently involve poor communication between the adversaries.</p>
<p class="ps10"><strong><span class="s5">Interest Conflicts</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps10">Interest conflicts are caused by competition over perceived incompatible needs. Conflicts of interest result when one or more of the parties believe that in order to satisfy his or her needs, the needs and interests of an opponent must be sacrificed- that a zero-sum game is being played. Interest-based conflict will commonly be expressed as power struggles and rank pulling. Interest conflicts may occur over <em><span class="s8">substantive issues</span></em> (such as money, physical resources, time, property crimes, etc.); <em><span class="s8">procedural issues</span></em> (the way the dispute is to be resolved); and <em><span class="s8">psychological issues</span></em> (assault and crimes of person, dominance, perceptions of trust, fairness, desire for participation, respect, etc.)</p>
<p class="ps10"><strong><span class="s5">Structural Conflicts</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps10">Structural conflicts are caused by forces external to the people in dispute. Limited physical resources or authority, geographic constraints (distance or proximity), time (too little or too much), organizational changes, and so forth can make structural conflict seem like a crisis. One possible outcome of a structural conflict- rare in fiction- is cooperation or a structural change. </p>
<p class="ps10"><strong><span class="s5">Value Conflicts</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps10">Value conflicts are caused by perceived or actual incompatible belief systems. Values are beliefs that people use to give meaning to their lives. People frequently coach values in terms of right and wrong. Value disputes arise when people attempt to force one set of values on others or lay claim to exclusive value systems that do not allow for divergent beliefs. Value conflicts are generally intractable.</p>
<p class="ps10"><strong><span class="s5">SubCategories</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps10">Each of these five categories can be further divided into subcategories.</p>
<p class="ps10"><em><span class="s8">Relationship Conflicts</span></em> differ according the the type of relationship. </p>
<p class="ps10"><em><span class="s8">Data Conflicts</span></em> differ according the type of information mismatch between the two parties.</p>

<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Take a look at this last one (‘8 causes’) against the categories I have. For example, ‘Policy’ may automatically point to structural issues.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Clausewitz describes war as “…a clash between major interests, which is resolved by bloodshed – that is the only way in which it differs from other conflicts.” </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The issue of information warfare</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">When it comes to an extremely important point, the morality of war, Clausewitz says: “the moral factor is the most fluid element of all, and therefore spreads most easily to affect everything else.” 9 </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">warfare is “Trinitarian.” Simply put, it is about people, armed forces, and government.12 </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">These dynamics are also part of a new strategic landscape of conflict. Traditionally, violent conflict has been associated with inter-state wars or civil wars, but there is increasing agreement among conflict analysts that most current violent conflicts do not fit these ‘traditional’ categories. For instance, most violent deaths occur in non-traditional conflict settings. The new landscape of conflict frequently I’nvolves a mix of ingredients such as local and cross-border organised crime, socio-economic exclusion, rapid urbanisation, political change after years of stasis, or long-standing disputes over land or identity. </p>

<p class="ps10">This is another rabbit hole. But a very interesting one.<em><span class="s8"> </span></em></p>
<p class="ps10">‘It turns out that all the advising and assisting, all the training and coaching, has only made matters worse. As for those overstretched forces, relentless deployments are evidently breaking them down as reports indicate that rates of mental distress and suicide are again on the rise among them. <br /></p>

<p class="ps13">The roles of major characters are often dictated by the genre. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For example, a western suggests a cowboy. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But placing a character in an unusual milieu can be very effective, as in the TV series <em><span class="s8">McCloud</span></em>, in which cowboy deputy McCloud is loaned to the NYPD and relocated from Taos, New Mexico to urban New York.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Another useful trick to liven up a role is to cross gender norms in casting the part, such as with a lady alligator wrestler, or a man who runs a wedding dress shop.</p>

<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">As with other social factors, changes in the ethnic and cultural environment can provide a source of story conflicts. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This happens in situations in which a person moves from one social group or strata to another, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>such as from employment, travel, or marriage.</p>

<h1 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s4">Psychological Tab</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps29"><br /></p>
<p class="ps25"><img alt="Character Psychological Tab" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img6" /></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">This tab contains information about the mental states and processes of the character.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><strong><span class="s5">Personality Type</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">There are a number of methods for classifying people according to personality type. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>For example, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Aristotle classified personalities according to 'humor', or temperament, into four categories: melancholic, sanguine, emotional, and phlegmatic. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Carl Jung classified people as introverted or extroverted, and also used four categories: sensation, thinking, feeling, and intuitive. StoryBuilder uses the Enneagram. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This system is very old, and is believed to have <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>originated with the Sufis in the Middle East. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It groups people into nine types ('ennea' is Greek for the number nine.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The system teaches that people in a given type often behave and react in similar ways.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">You may wish to use personality types to better understand what motivates your characters, and how they may think and feel in certain situations. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But remember that a personality type is just a <em><span class="s8">stereotype</span></em>. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>No two people are alike: one may be an only child; the other, the youngest in a <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>large family. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>One could be born to poverty, another to luxury. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Each character is shaped by different experiences.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Intelligence</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Intelligence is the capacity to grasp meaning. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Action-based stories generally <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>require less intelligence in the protagonist than do character-based stories. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A character who reacts, rather than acts, can be less intelligent.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The antagonist should generally be as intelligent as the protagonist, to insure a fair struggle.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Values</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">People can have vastly different ideas of what is right or worthwhile in life. These 'governing values' are seldom articulated, but maintaining and defending them is a large influence on an individual's behavior, because her self image is tied to the values she holds.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">In real life, people have multiple values. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In fiction, it's more useful to think in terms of just one or two values. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Conflict can be created by threatening your character's important value, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>by giving her two opposing or exclusive values, or by destroying or removing a value.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Another way values can cause conflict (and therefore stories) is through misalignment of Values and Focus. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For example, if a man values his family, but spends too much time earning money to support them, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>this can cause problems.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The choices for this trait represent common values people hold. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Be aware that different social backgrounds (especially different cultures and educational experiences) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>may have profound effects on values.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><strong><span class="s5">Abnormality</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">This control describes the abnormal mental state of a character.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The line between normal and abnormal behavior is one of degrees. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Nor should you restrict unusual behavior to your villains. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A touch of abnormality adds color and unpredictability to a character.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Abnormal behaviors are complex and difficult to describe. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Be sure to research the specific illness you're using carefully.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><strong><span class="s5">Focus</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The character's Focus is where he places his attention and activity. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>His Focus (along with his Values) determine what's important to him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>From the perspective of plotting, these frequently determine what's at stake for the character, and therefore what should be put at risk— in other words, what the story problem should be about.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">A character's Focus and his Values can be at odds, as a source of conflict in the story.</p>
<p class="ps13">The character may discover that what he thinks is important isn't, or that values and focus he has neglected are truly important to him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Stories of discovery and decision are often concerned with these traits.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>

<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps25"><img alt="Character Inner Traits Tab" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img6" /></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">A trait is a distinguishing characteristic or quality. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>As a fiction writer, you may find it useful to think of inner and outer (external) traits. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Inner traits are aspects of <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>character stemming from psychological and social causes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>External traits are habits and behaviors which reflect and illustrate the inner traits. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For instance, a girl may be submissive toward her mother (an inner trait) and may reflect it by bringing her small presents each day (an outer trait.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>You will want to find external traits to illuminate the inner traits of your characters, following the 'show, don't tell' maxim.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">In the real world there are countless external traits, but fewer inner traits. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The <strong><span class="s5">Inner Traits</span></strong> tab can be used to select your character's inner characteristics. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Record external traits in the note areas for characteristics such as <strong><span class="s5">Likes and Dislikes</span></strong>,  <strong><span class="s5">Habits</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="s5">Skills and Abilities</span></strong>.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">A menu item on the <strong><span class="s5">Characterization Aids</span></strong> sub-menu of the <strong><span class="s5">Tools</span></strong> menu,  <strong><span class="s5">Virtues and Vices</span></strong>, lists some external traits which can be positive and negative forces in the story, as well as sources of conflict.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Don't go overboard and provide every possible trait for a character. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Focus on the traits which serve your story's premise (see &#34;Plotting through character&#34;.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Real people are often <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>complicated and confusing. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Characters should be multi-dimensional, but their motives, strengths, flaws, and growth should be clear and understandable to the reader.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Both the <strong><span class="s5">Inner Traits</span></strong> tab and the <strong><span class="s5">Virtues and Vices</span></strong> list in StoryBuilder can be tailored to your needs and wishes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>See &#34;Customizing StoryBuilder&#34; for details on how to add, delete, or modify the listed traits.</p>

<p class="ps19">The other senses are often neglected but can be very important. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Smells in particular can be effective in pulling a reader into a story; the sense of smell is primitive and powerful and taps into deep emotions.</p>

<p class="ps13">Georges Polti, in his 1895 book <em><span class="s8">The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations</span></em>, proposed that there are only a limited number of dramatic situations, based on fundamental human conflicts. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>He defined each of his situations in terms of dramatic elements and examples.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">In 2017 Mike Figgis, whose film credits include <em><span class="s8">Internal Affairs</span></em> and <em><span class="s8">Leaving Los Vegas</span></em>, revised and republished <em><span class="s8">The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations</span></em>, adapting the dated examples from long-forgotten writers Polti used to the more modern era and borrowing examples from cinema. This is the source we use. </p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">The <strong><span class="s5">Dramatic Situations</span></strong> form is invoked from the <strong><span class="s5">Plotting Aids</span></strong> sub-menu of the <strong><span class="s5">Tools</span></strong> menu. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It contains the thirty-six dramatic situations and the dramatic elements of each.</p>

<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">How much should I outline? How detailed should my outline be? </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Lisa Gardner, in <em><span class="s8">Plotting the Novel: Otherwise Known as The Real Reason Writers are Neurotic</span></em>, writes:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps93">And finally, you may complete this process only to discover that now that you have outlined the story, you have no interest in writing it. That means outlining is not for you. You are probably an “out-of-the-mist” writer, meaning that the story must be unfolding fresh for you to be interested in telling it. That’s okay as well. Some of the best writers out there are out-of-the-mist writers. The trick is to discover which method of writing works best for you. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">This ‘two styles of writer’ distinction is known in writing circles as ‘Plotters vs. Pantsers’. Plotters plan and outline; Pantsers write ‘by the seat of their pants’, by sitting down and writing. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">What’s different between these two positions? Several things: </p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps94">The Plotter must still write her draft. In fact, that’s one downside to being a plotter: you can confuse writing the outline with writing the story, even tell yourself that the story’s done.</li>
  <li class="ps94">The Pantser is more likely to write herself into a corner, to not know what comes next.</li>
  <li class="ps94">The Pantser finishes her first draft. It contains all that knowledge needed to rewrite a second draft, but it’s diffused, spread throughout the prose. She has to edit much more extensively than if she worked from a good outline.</li>
  <li class="ps95">Here’s the killer: the Pantser had to face a blank page every day in order to get through that draft.  She often worked without a net, not knowing where her story was going. The plotter did too- <em><span class="s8">while she was writing her outline</span></em>. But there is a big difference in writing a few pages of outline and in writing a 200-page draft. The outline is more tractable. That’s what makes Pantsing a plotting issue.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ps6">The gap between these two perspectives, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>and the answer to the original questions, is to outline as little as possible to get to an effective first draft. The trick is to develop an effective workflow, one that gets you to the writing as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span"><span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span></span></p>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc68"></a><strong><span class="s1">Workflow</span></strong></h1>
<h1 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s4">Workflow</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">According to IBM, a workflow is ‘a system for managing repetitive processes and tasks which occur in a particular order.’ Each step in a workflow is a simple series of individual tasks, and focusing on just one step at a time divides the larger job (outlining your novel, for instance) into a series of smaller jobs.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder divides your outline into 'story elements', such as characters, problems (the conflicts that drive the story), scenes (your plot structure), and settings.  </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Story elements are the building blocks of fiction. They're taught in classes and writer's workshops, distilled in a story summary or synopsis, and they're what readers describe when discussing a story. In StoryBuilder, you’ll mostly be working with the big four: Problem, Character, Setting, and Scene. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>These story elements are created from templates- forms which organize and assist in thinking about that particular aspect of your story. </p>
<p class="ps19">Story Elements can be readily changed, moved around, or even thrown out and replaced with something better. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Each story element is a tangible object; <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>its template describes it, breaks it down into smaller elements, and provides a you in its creation. A series of tabs organizes your work on that story element and focuses on one aspect of it. Y<strong><span class="s5">ou can fill in as much or little of a story element as you like or need</span></strong>. A Scene might contain only a sketch of what happens to start with, but be fleshed out with a setting, cast, cause, consequence, meaning, conflict, and its effect on the plot, depending on your needs. If you can write the scene from just the sketch, do so; if it’s not working for you, try expanding on it. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Many template elements are pull-down lists of choices. StoryBuilder contains <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>thousands of suggestions for these parts, although you're generally not required to stick to them. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>They (the suggestions) aren't there to limit your imagination, but to encourage it, to eliminate writer's block. Think of them as examples. The trick to using StoryBuilder’s suggestions is specificity. This can’t be emphasized enough. Be specific. Instead of a Protagonist Goal of ‘Relief from danger’, try ‘Santiago must fight off the sharks to protect his catch’. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Once you understand story elements this way, you can think of them as parts in your story factory, designing them and fitting them together, or modifying them to better fit your design. You can even copy characters and settings from one story to another or into shared story worlds. </p>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">IBM’s <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>definition of workflow mentions ‘in a particular order’. With StoryBuilder, this translates into creating certain story elements in a particular sequence. Your individual workflow may and probably will be different from other writers (or even different from one project to the next), but the general sequence is fairly constant and be thought of as <strong><span class="s5">Phases of Development</span></strong>, which are:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps96">Story Idea, Concept, and Premise</p>
<p class="ps96">Problem and Character Development  </p>
<p class="ps96">Plotting</p>
<p class="ps96">Ordering the Narrative</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Each of these will be described in detail. These outlining or planning phases are followed by: </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps97">Drafting</p>
<p class="ps97">Revision</p>
<p class="ps98"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">These workflow phases are outside of StoryBuilder’s scope and depend on other tools. We recommend Scrivener, which StoryBuilder has an interface to, but you can of course use the word processor of your choice. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Saying that drafting and revising your story is outside of StoryBuilder’s scope is not quite accurate; outlining can be useful during both phases, and we discuss that in <strong><span class="s5">Other Uses of StoryBuilder</span></strong>.</p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc69"></a><strong><span class="s1">Story Idea, Concept, and Premise</span></strong></h1>

<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">A new story outline begins with the <strong><span class="s5">Story Overview</span></strong> form. It contains:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps47">Story Idea</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps47">Concept</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps47">Premise </li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps47">Structure</li>
</ul>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The<strong><span class="s5"> Story Overview </span></strong>form contains everything needed to get started, working through each of these tabs in order.</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Story Idea</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Every story starts with an idea. The idea might come from anywhere. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A conversation might lead to a bit of dialog; someone you see in a crowd could suggest an interesting character; a newspaper article or story you're read or movie you've seen might spark an idea for a conflict. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>You’ll have more ideas than you can possibly write about, but regardless of where the idea comes from or how complete it is, at the moment of conception it's all you have, so a good place to start is to capture the idea. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Launch StoryBuilder and use Create New Story from the open menu. Change the story’s working title to something similar to its project name and simply jot down whatever notes or thoughts you have regarding the story.</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Idea to Concept</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps99"><strong><span class="s5">A concept</span></strong> <strong><span class="s5">is an idea that asks a question that implies conflict</span></strong>. </p>
<p class="ps99">The answer to that question is what gives you your story, and it often works best if framed as a &#34;what if&#34; question. The Concept question should be the question the reader needs answered- it’s what propells him to read your story.</p>
<p class="ps99">Concept formulation is all about questions, and isn’t necessarily limited to just one “what if” question. In fact, a good “what if” should spark more questions. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Consider Dan Brown’s <em><span class="s8">The da Vinci Code</span></em> for example:</p>
<p class="ps100"><br /></p>
<p class="ps101"><span class="s25">What if Leonardo da Vinci implanted clues as to his views on Christianity and the veracity of scripture within his painting of “The Last Supper?”</span></p>
<p class="ps102"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps103">What if Christ didn’t die on the cross after all?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps103">What if the entire Christian religion is a contrivance and a deeply held secret resulting in a conspiracy?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps103">What if there is a highly secret group of men whose life mission is to preserve that secret?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps103">What if they are willing to kill to protect it?</li>
</ul>
<p class="ps6">… and so on.</p>
<p class="ps99">Another good question is <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>“what happens?”, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>particularly framed as a response to your “what if” question. It’s an account of your story’s resolution.</p>
<p class="ps104"><span class="s26">Your concept </span><strong><span class="s27">must</span></strong><span class="s26"> imply conflict. To form a good concept, first ask: &#34;What happens if this crosses that?&#34; If you rub <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>things together, there is going to be a fire. What happens when you bring two people together who want different things? </span></p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Concept to Premise</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps105"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Your Premise is the answer to the question the Concept poses.  </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Your story can have more than one Problem story element, and every Problem has its own Premise, contained on the Resolution tab. But only one of these problems is your Story Problem, and that Problem <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>(and its Premise) is the one you select on the <strong><span class="s5">Story Overview</span></strong> form, Premise tab:</p>

<p class="ps99">The heart of plotted fiction is <em><span class="s8">drama</span></em>— a struggle in which the outcome is in doubt. Your Story Problem will lead you to understand whose problem it is (your major character), what her or she want (the goal), and what stands in their way (opposition.) The Story Problem is the wormhole you enter to understand your story.</p>
<p class="ps100"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The Story Problem has to be both difficult and urgent enough to occupy your reader from the story’s beginning to its end: <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>in Eric Bork’s words, “One big problem it takes the whole movie to solve.” Your story isn’t over until the Story Problem is resolved.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Before you can select your Story Problem, you have to define it. You may have created your new outline using a template that gives you blank Problem story elements (External and Internal Problems or Problems and Characters). Pick one (usually the External problem), or add a new Problem, and outline it in such a way as to satisfy your concept.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Once you have created a Story Problem that seems fit, write your Premise. The premise is a condensation or synopsis of the story problem; its purpose is to be absolutely clear as to that problem and how its resolution will resolve the story. One pattern for a premise is as follows:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps106">A <strong><span class="s5">character </span></strong>in a situation<strong><span class="s5"> [genre, setting]</span></strong> <strong><span class="s5">wants something</span></strong>, which brings him into <strong><span class="s5">conflict</span></strong> with a second character [<strong><span class="s5">opposition</span></strong>]. After a <strong><span class="s5">series of conflicts</span></strong>, which are handicapped by a <strong><span class="s5">subplot</span></strong>, and after a <strong><span class="s5">plot twist</span></strong>, the <strong><span class="s5">final battle</span></strong> erupts, and character one finally <strong><span class="s5">resolves</span></strong> the conflict.</p>
<p class="ps18"><br /></p>
<p class="ps17">Your premise doesn’t have to be worded in this format, but it should contain these elements. Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<p class="ps17"><strong><span class="s28">Jaws</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="s29">When a fish-out-of-water, big-city cop </span><span class="s30">(protagonist)</span><span class="s29"> moves to a small, coastal town dependent on tourism </span><span class="s30">(situation),</span><span class="s29"> he must team with an oceanographer and a crusty sailor to convince the doubting, money-grubbing townsfolk to close their beaches because a giant, man-eating shark </span><span class="s30">(opponent)</span><span class="s29"> is lurking just offshore,  </span><span class="s30">(objective)</span><span class="s29"> until the shark strikes </span><span class="s30">(disaster),</span><span class="s29"> forcing the townsfolk to allow the cop and his buddies to take on the shark mano-a-mano </span><span class="s30">(conflict).</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><strong><span class="s5">Star Wars</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps107"><span class="s31">A restless farm boy (</span><span class="s32">situation</span><span class="s31">) Luke Skywalker (</span><span class="s32">the protagonist</span><span class="s31">) wants nothing more than to leave home and become a Starfighter pilot so he can live up to his mysterious father (</span><span class="s32">objective</span><span class="s31">). But when his aunt and uncle are murdered (</span><span class="s32">disaster</span><span class="s31">) after purchasing renegade droids, Luke must free the droids’ beautiful owner and discover a way to stop (</span><span class="s32">conflict</span><span class="s31">) the evil Empire (</span><span class="s32">opponent</span><span class="s31">) and its apocalyptic Death Star.</span></p>

<h1 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s4">Problem and Character Development</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">A StoryBuilder outline ‘begins’ on the Story Overview form, but as you’ve seen, it really starts with the selection of the Story Problem and its description in its Premise, whose definition could be condensed to ‘a character with a problem.’ </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">How you approach these depends on the particular story, but also upon your own personality and style. You may be more character-driven, and need to understand your character’s journey to make sense of your story. Or perhaps you’re more driven by abstractions- ideas, concepts, situations and events. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Perhaps you’re comfortable with both. One isn’t better than the other, and you need both in order to complete your outline.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Always honor your muse by recording whatever it gifts you about your story: a bit of character description, a dialog or trait, a possible scene or subplot, a philosophical question a web link. This is a good time to brainstorm. But also, focus on the intersections of problem and character: your protagonist’s goal and motivation. After those are firmly in mind, concentrate on the nature of your conflict and its outcome. Once your protagonist’s inner traits and beliefs are molded, they cannot easily change, and he or she can only act in certain ways. Th other story elements must be consistent with your character's nature. Be prepared to amend your problem to fit that character.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"> If you started with the problem (situation, idea, etc.), remember that there are infinitely many possible characters. Your job is to find the character who will face this particular problem. Ask why he wants to achieve that particular goal, and what sort of traits would lead to the story conclusion you want. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Then devise a back story which gives your character those traits. Until the moment your story concept is fully developed, your characters are as fluid and tractable to change as your plot or settings. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc71"></a><strong><span class="s1">Defining Problems</span></strong></h1>
<h1 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s4">Defining Problems</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">In StoryBuilder the Problem form is the key to creating an outline. You want to motivate your audience to keep reading or viewing your story, and Problems create suspense and tension through uncertain outcomes. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder’s Problem form is based on three <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>elements: Goal, Motivation, and Conflict, and is based on the book <em><span class="s8">GMC: Goal, Motivation, and Conflict</span></em> by Debra Dixon. The goal is what your character wants, the motivation is why they want it, and the conflict is what they’ll have to overcome to achieve the goal.</p>
<p class="ps109">What makes GMC interesting is that it deals with the intersection of character and plot. The literature of the craft of writing often discusses the need for strong characters, and of the need for good plots. GMC ties them together. Plot is the character's attempt to overcome the opposition and achieve the goal. The Problem form links to the problem’s protagonist and antagonist, which you must have defined as Character story elements. This leads you further down the wormhole towards fully developing your outline.</p>
<p class="ps109">The Problem form’s tie to Character forms supports various approaches to story creation. You may start from an idea, concept or situation, and think of your problems more in terms of the events that must unfold (plot-oriented), or you may start from the conception of a character, and find that character’s problem. Your story needs both a plot and characters, and centering on your outline’s Problems can give you both.</p>
<p class="ps109">Problems server a variety of roles in a story:</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Story Problem</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">As was mentioned under <strong><span class="s2">Ideation</span></strong>, one problem is the Story Problem, the spine of the story. The Story Problem’s Protagonist is the Story’s main character. When the Story Problem is resolved, the story’s over.</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Outer and Inner Problems</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The story's action, the plot, comes from the external events which occur as the characters struggle to reach their goals. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Similarly, character growth and development occurs as characters struggle to reach their goals. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The difference is whether the problem is an outer one or an inner one. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">An outer problem is the character's struggle to achieve some physical goal— to solve a problem, to win the love of his life, to find a treasure.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">An inner problem is some want or need within the character himself, a need to grow or change. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This problem may be some character flaw or psychological hurdle to overcome. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It may be the real reason why the character pursues his external goal, even though the superficial reason he gives is quite different. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The character frequently doesn't know that he has an inner problem at the start of the story, and sometimes, in tragic endings, refuses to acknowledge or resolve the inner problem.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">It's often constructive to use StoryBuilder to define both an external and an internal problem for your protagonist, with separate Problem forms for each <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>of them. Both problems help to shape the story's plot. There’s even a <strong><span class="s5">Create New Story</span></strong> template for this:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="" src="fghyujk_files/Clipboard-Image_8.png" class="img26" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The outer problem asks 'what does the character want?' <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The inner problem asks 'why does he want it?' <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The outer problem is tangible. The inner problem is intangible, invisible. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The outer problem faces an external adversary. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The inner problem is Man against Himself, usually with something to decide or discover. The outer problem is solved when (win or loose) something is accomplished. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The inner problem is solved when the character grows or changes, or fails to do so. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The inner problem is related to theme. The two problems are connected because your protagonist must come to grips with his inner demon before he can solve the external, outer problem.</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Complications</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"> Just as in real life, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>one problem often leads to another. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>These complications must be causally linked, just as scenes must be. Complications make things worse for your protagonist, escalate conflict, and build toward your story’s climax. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">A good example of this is found in Hemingway's <em><span class="s8">The Old Man and the Sea.</span></em> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This novelette consists of three sections, each of which is a separate story problem. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In the first problem, the old Cuban fisherman hasn't caught a fish for over eighty days, and the Story Question is 'Will he catch a fish before he starves to death?' <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>After a struggle, he hooks a giant marlin. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The first problem is solved, but a second problem emerges: <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>the fish is so gigantic that catching it is doubtful; the Story Question is 'Can he catch the fish?' <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>After an epic battle he does kill the fish and secure it to the side of his small boat. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But a final story problem emerges when sharks appear and attack the fish. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The Story Question is 'Can the fisherman save his catch and bring the marlin safely to shore?'</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Rather than arrange these problems in a list:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="" src="fghyujk_files/Clipboard-Image_9.png" class="img27" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">You may want arrange them as children of the original problem, which won’t be solved until the complications are:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="" src="fghyujk_files/Clipboard-Image_10.png" class="img28" /></p>
<h2 class="ps110"><br /></h2>
<p class="ps19">Where possible, complications should be ordered to make things progressively worse for the protagonist. By the end of the shark attack, the marlin is nothing but a head and tail and skeleton; things can’t get much worse for Santiago.</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Subplots</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps30"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Complications and inner conflicts are two ways in which a story is made richer and more complex by containing more than one problem. A story can also contain problems distinct from the main story problem and which run parallel to it. These often center around characters other than the protagonist. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">A subplot may expand on a character relationship. Romance subplots are examples. The Character form’s Relationship tab explores a variety of possible relationships. The subplot will be one of inner conflict.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">In <em><span class="s8">The Old Man and the Sea</span></em>, a subplot revolves around the relationship between the old man, Santiago, and the boy Manolin. Hemingway writes that Santiago, as mentor, had taught Manolin to fish, and that Manolin loved him. But <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>at the start of the story, we’re given clues that the relationship has changed: <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Manolin now carries the old man’s net, and makes sure that he has enough to eat, while taking care to protect Santiago’s dignity. The subplot’s problem is that Manolin’s parents think Santiago is jinxed, unlucky, and have ordered Manolin to go out on a more prosperous boat. This information is presented at the start of the story, but Manolin’s problem isn’t resolved until the end, framing the old man’s battle with the sea, when Manolin tells Santiago that he’ll fish with the old man tomorrow, for he (Manolin) has much to learn. This character growth by Manolin resonates with Santiago’s epic battle with the Marlin and the sharks.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">A subplot may explore or test the protagonist’s goal and motivation by comparison and contrast. One example is the ‘mirror’ subplot, a problem which is similar to the protagonist’s, but with a different outcome. Another is a ‘refusal of the call’ subplot in which a supporting character refuses to participate in your protagonist’s journey.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The one characteristic all subplots (and complications, and inner problems) must face is that they must relate and contribute to the Story Problem in some fashion. Otherwise, your audience will be left wondering why this strange story is embedded in your tale.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><strong><span class="s2">Problem Workflow</span></strong></p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">The Problem form contains four tabs:</span></strong></h2>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Problem Tab</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The problem tab identifies the problem in general, and frames it in the form of a question, the general shape of which is ‘Will the protagonist achieve his or her goal?’ In essence, it’s a summary of the problem.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Protagonist Tab </span></strong></h2>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Antagonist Tab</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">These two tabs are identical, and both contain all three GMC elements. What differs is the role: Protagonist is derived from a Greek word meaning the main actor (the ‘first actor’); Antagonist (from the Greek words ‘anti’ (against) and ‘agonist’ (actor), is the opposition or foil to the protagonist. Although many problems don’t have human adversaries for your Protagonist (Person vs. Nature, Person vs. Society, etc.), it’s usually a good idea to cast the opposition as a character, or perhaps to create a human character who personifies the opposition. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The role of Protagonist is not about good or bad; it’s about ‘Whose story is it?’ Your protagonists can be and anti-hero, with few or no hero-like traits. He can even be a villain, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>as in <em><span class="s8">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</span></em>, Dexter the serial killer, or Maleficent from the Sleeping Beauty retelling.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">It’s important to understand that your Antagonist has his own Goal and Motivation, and his own Conflict: his opposition is your Protagonist. It’s been said that no man is a villain in his own eyes. That may or may not be true, but he will certainly have his reasons for his behavior, even if they’re rooted in abnormal psychiatry. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Of But a villain’s motive may be more relatable, rooted in greed, humiliation, pride, anger, or heartache. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A common characteristic of villains is that they’re in over their head: a small mistake grows larger over time.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder includes a tool, Conflict Builder, which describers conflicts into categories and examples from the world of conflict resolution that go beyond creating a cardboard ‘bad guy’ adversary.</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Resolution Tab</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The resolution is the outcome of the problem. Outcomes can be generalized into 'successful' or 'not successful', but the choices listed for this story element are more useful. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>They represent story patterns which recur throughout fiction.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The outcome is the actual results or end of the problem.  </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The generalized outcomes are:</p>

<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Defining Characters</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Character is the most important element of most great fiction. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A memorable character will live in the mind of the reader long after details of the story are forgotten. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Sequels are written about characters much more frequently than about the events in a story. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">A memorable character is a gestalt, the sum total of his or her physical, mental, emotional, and social characteristics. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A real person has all of these traits, and we expect a believable fiction character to be equally multifaceted. The <strong><span class="s5">Character</span></strong> form’s eleven tabs can provide you a rounded, three-dimensional character. Not all characters need that much detail: some are bit players or have lesser roles. But early in your story’s development, you need to meet and get to know your major characters: <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>how they look, act and talk.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">As with all the elements of a story outline, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>be specific and use details. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Giving the reader these details allows him to explore the character and learn his personality for himself, which is more effective than any explanation.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">To go beyond the stereotypical, your characters should contain contradictions and flaws, just as real people do. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>To build these paradoxical elements into a character, start with a fairly well-drawn character, and ask yourself what trait or characteristic would be at odds with that personality. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Then write the trait in. Often the contradiction can be built into the character's back story.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">When you’re defining your characters, use conflict as a lens. Conflict <em><span class="s8">is</span></em> your story; always look for opportunities to increase it.</p>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Agency</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Your characters are your story’s actors, and so they must <em><span class="s8">act.</span></em> Thy must make decisions and carry them out, successfully or not; they <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>must drive the story more than be driven by events. Your story’s plot unfolds as a direct result of your protagonist’s and antagonist’s (and other major character’s) actions.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">At the risk of being repetitive, the keys to this are your character’s goals and motivations, which brings you back to the Problem form. If <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>a character lacks agency, up his or her stakes.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Action, particularly action at crisis, reveals character. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Your characters must act in accordance with their nature. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Psychological factors such as Values and Focus and Inner Traits will show through. A character also needs (or must learn) the skills and abilities to act effectively. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Action also molds character. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Normally, in fiction as in life, this occurs where the character's <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>innermost qualities are untested. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>When a crisis calls upon your character to do new things, the inner traits will be revealed. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>People can also sometimes change their inner values in fundamental ways. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This usually requires him or her <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>to 'go through the fire', <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>to undergo literally life-changing experiences. StoryBuilder provides several ways to outline such changes. One is to describe an internal ‘Person vs. Himself’ problem and its outcome. The <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>other is to identify a character defect using the Flaw tab on the Character form, and resolve it. A tool, Flaw Builder, can help with this. These two approaches aren’t meant to be mutually exclusive. Finding a flaw exposes a character’s need, a goal hidden from the character herself. That goal is the basis of the Problem the character must solve through character growth. These are often problems of discovery or decision. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Wants, Needs, and Flaws</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps111"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">You’ve defined what your protagonist wants, his external goal. But we humans have an extraordinary ability to deceive ourselves, and our goals are sometimes the very means of deception. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The <strong><span class="s5">Defining Problems </span></strong>topic <strong><span class="s5">Outer and Inner Problems</span></strong> defined an inner <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>problem is some want or need within the character himself, a need to grow or change. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Having both a want (the external goal) and the need (a flaw or wound that’s often buried and not allowed to surface) exposes a ‘wants versus needs’ conflict, and a potentially richer story. In these cases, what your character wants (the goal) and why he wants it (the motive) are at odds. Often what a character believes his motivation to be is a lie.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps111"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s2">Socialization and Relationships</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The Social Tab’s elements are the major factors which affect this character's behavior that come from the influence of others or the community.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The four socializing factors on this tab are important, but there is another, equally important source of social influence: specific relationships with other people. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Parents are notable examples.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Social factors may war with each other in an individual, as a source of story conflict. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For example, a young white boy might have been raised to dislike or distrust blacks, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>but the positive influence of a particular person of color could contradict that background. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This type of conflict is common in 'Man against Society' stories.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Wealth is a form of freedom; the poor are often shorn of choices which the wealthy enjoy. However, wealth can also serve as an insulator, which isolates a character from real life. This is true more of inherited than earned money, so also consider how the wealth was acquired. Changes in economic status can be powerful sources of conflict; that works in both directions, towards richer but also towards poorer.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Education</span></strong> is a primary means of social mobility, or rising above poverty or humble beginnings. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But education is also sometimes associated with class separation, snobbish behavior, and lack of worldliness. </p>
<p class="ps19">In either roll, positive or negative, education can place a character in conflict with his earlier environment.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The <strong><span class="s5">Ethnic and Cultural </span></strong>background of the character provide great color and variety to stories.</p>
<p class="ps19">Be sure that you know the ethnic group or culture you're writing about, either from experience or from careful research— or both. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Be wary of stereotyping. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In fact, interesting characters often come from providing character traits which are at deliberate odds to stereotypes.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">As with other social factors, changes in the ethnic and cultural environment can provide a source of story conflicts. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This happens in situations in which a person moves from one social group or strata to another, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>such as from employment, travel, or marriage.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Religion</span></strong> is not widely used in fictional character development, except in religious market genres. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Characters frequently express religious beliefs, but don't show or act upon them except in unusual circumstances. But religion can provide a foundation for characters in crisis, a source of comfort and strength when things are at their darkest. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A religious background can provide the basis for character choices at the turning point. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This is especially true for stories in which the protagonist is on the brink of a fall into immoral or unethical behavior.</p>
<p class="ps112"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Personality Type</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">There are a number of methods for classifying people according to type. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>For example, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Aristotle classified personalities according to 'humor', or temperament, into four categories: melancholic, sanguine, emotional, and phlegmatic. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Carl Jung classified people as introverted or extroverted, and also used four categories: sensation, thinking, feeling, and intuitive. Today a system called Briggs-Myers Type Indicators, which classifies personality along four scales (such as extroversion / introversion), for a total of sixteen unique categories.  </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">StoryBuilder uses <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>a different approach: the Enneagram. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This system is very old, and is believed to have <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>originated with the Sufis. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It groups people into nine types ('ennea' is Greek for the number nine.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The system teaches that people in a given type often behave and react in similar ways.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">You may wish to use personality types to better understand what motivates your characters, and how they may think and feel in certain situations. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But remember that a personality type is just a <em><span class="s8">stereotype</span></em>. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>No two people are alike: one may be an only child; the other, the youngest in a <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>large family. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>One could be born to poverty, another to luxury. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Each character is shaped by different experiences.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Intelligence</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Intelligence is the capacity to grasp meaning. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Action-based stories generally <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>require less intelligence in the protagonist than do character-based stories. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A character who reacts, rather than acts, can be less intelligent. Your antagonist should be about <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>as intelligent as the protagonist, to insure a fair struggle. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Values</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">People can have vastly different ideas of what is right or worthwhile in life. These 'governing values' are seldom articulated, but maintaining and defending them is a huge influence on an individual's behavior, because her self image is tied to the values she holds.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">In real life, people have multiple values. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In fiction, it's more useful to think in terms of just one or two values. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Conflict can be created by threatening your character's important value, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>by giving her two opposing or exclusive values, or by destroying or removing a value.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The choices for this trait represent common values people hold. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Be aware that different social backgrounds (especially different cultures and educational experiences) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>may have profound effects on values.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Focus</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The character's Focus is where he places his attention and activity. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>His Focus (along with his Values) determine what's important to him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>From the perspective of plotting, these frequently determine what's at stake for the character, and therefore what should be put at risk— in other words, what the story problem should be about.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Misalignment of Values and Focus can create conflict. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For example, if a man values his family, but spends too much time earning money to support them, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>this can cause problems. Your character may discover that what he thinks is important isn't, or that values he has neglected are truly important to him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Stories of discovery and decision are often concerned with these situations.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s5">Abnormality</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">This control describes the abnormal mental state of a character.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">The line between normal and abnormal behavior is one of degrees. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Nor should you restrict unusual behavior to your villains. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A touch of abnormality adds color and unpredictability to a character.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Abnormal behaviors are complex and difficult to describe. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Be sure to research the specific illness you're using carefully. </p>

<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">A trait is a distinguishing quality. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Unlike Psychological qualities which are hidden, these are a character’s attributes which can be seen and recognized through their behavior. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Inner traits are aspects of <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>character stemming from psychological and social causes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>External traits are habits, choices and behaviors which often reflect and illustrate the inner traits. For instance, a girl may be submissive toward her mother (an inner trait) and may reflect it by bringing her small presents each day (an outer trait.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>You will want to find external traits to illuminate the inner traits of your characters, following the 'show, don't tell' maxim.</p>

<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">The Importance of Setting</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Setting often receives less attention than other story elements such as Problem and Character, and it does in this document as well.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">But setting is more than just the backdrop of the story; plot and character are shaped and limited by the choice of setting. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Settings:</p>
<p class="ps113"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps26">Provide much of the verisimilitude of the story, making it real and believable to the reader.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ps113"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps26">Provide excitement and color. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Much of the joy of fiction is to allow the reader to travel to other times, other places, and even other worlds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ps113"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps26">Establish mood and tone.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ps113"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="ps26">Provide a source of symbolism and meaning for the story.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">A Scene’s settings ties characters and their actions together. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Generally, unless you unite your protagonist and antagonist at one place and time, there is no conflict.  </p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13">Confined settings increase dramatic tension: for example, <em><span class="s8">Murder on the Orient Express</span></em>, or <em><span class="s8">Titanic</span></em>. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Setting also establishes the framework of beliefs and scope of action which some characters are more comfortable in. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A cowboy belongs in a western setting in ways that a ballet dancer or biochemist don't. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But placing characters in unusual settings can create or increase drama.</p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc74"></a><strong><span class="s1">Plotting in Scenes</span></strong></h1>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Plotting in Scenes</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps114"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Outlining your story at the scene level (plotting) is where you move from the abstract level of characters and their problems to the specific events you’ll draft your story from.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Before diving into plotting in detail, we should define a few terms.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Let’s start with <strong><span class="s5">plot</span></strong>. The definition we like is borrowed from science fiction writer Jack Williamson, who defines plot as a patterned sequence of events, related by cause and effect, which portrays the whole response of a set of characters to a situation. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Each separate event is a <strong><span class="s5">Scene</span></strong> story element. A scene takes place at one location and time, and has a specific cast of characters interacting with each other. Stage plays and movie scripts are necessarily written almost exclusively in scenes. Other story forms, such as novels and short stories can contain foreshortened prose, but these days even those forms are mainly written in scenes, perhaps due to the influence of movies and television.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Certain events usually happen at fixed places in a story, a pattern called <strong><span class="s5">story structure</span></strong>. A plot has a beginning, middle, and end. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Aristotle described it as consisting of three movements, or acts. The first act, or setup, introduces us with characters with problems that must be solved. The second act, or rising action, presents obstacles as the characters try to solve their problems. The third act contains the logical outcome of the events in the first two acts. Most stories’ plots follow Aristotle's idea of story structure. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The things that happen at a certain place in the plot (introduce the protagonist, present the problem to be solved, introduce an obstacle, solve the story problem (the climax), and so forth) are often called <strong><span class="s5">plot points</span></strong>, which the Oxford Dictionary defines as ‘a particularly significant part of a work of fiction.’ Another term for a plot point is a <strong><span class="s5">story beat</span></strong>.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc75"></a><strong><span class="s1">Plotting Tools</span></strong></h1>
<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Plotting Tools</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps8"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">StoryBuilder comes with three tools to help you plot your story.</p>
<p class="ps7"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><strong><span class="s2">MasterPlots</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">In recent decades, the three-act structure has been joined by a bevy of other story structures, with different plot points: <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Dan Wells’ Seven Point Structure, The Hero’s Journey, Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat, and many more. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Since plot points are also called story beats, these structures are often called ‘beat sheets’. A beat sheet can serve as a sort of plot template. StoryBuilder’s Master Plots tool provides a number of these templates, which will insert a set of Scene story elements into your outline at the place of your choosing:</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><img alt="Tools Master Plots 2" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img29" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Since every Problem is a ‘small story’ and has its own set of events that define it, a Problem is good place to use this tool. A Problem can be thought of as a <strong><span class="s5">sequence</span></strong>, a term used frequently in scriptwriting, which is defined as ‘a series of scenes with a beginning, middle, and end.’ Or, if you prefer, setup, development, and resolution. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Here’s what using the Three Act Play will do if you add it after a problem:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="Tools Master Plots Result" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img6" /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">These are not scene summaries; it’s up to you to outline the scene itself, and the process will be described a little later. These are plot points, or story beats. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Master Plots populates the template scene’s Notes tab with what <em><span class="s8">should</span></em> happen at that point in the template. The actual scenes might start off like this:</p>

<p class="ps19">The Dramatic Situations tool, based on Polti’s and Figgis’ books (both titled <em><span class="s8">The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations</span></em>), lists a set of situations with roles in opposition and uncertain outcomes- which is to say, situations with built-in drama and conflict:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><img alt="Dramatic Situations List of SItuations" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img6" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Although the world has changed greatly since Polti’s 1895 book, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>the situations remain relevant, because they’re very <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>human situations. Mike Figgis recommends using loose rather than literal interpretations of the situations. He points out that these 36 situations work for both outer and inner problems and at varied scales: Disaster<em><span class="s8">,</span></em> one of the situations, ‘can be a war or an earthquake or the sinking of the Titanic’, but also <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>‘in a more intimated love story, it could be a case of unrequited love, the loved one marries another person, a personal disaster of the highest magnitude.’</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">StoryBuilder’s adjusts to scale by allowing you to select a dramatic situation as either a Problem or a Scene story element:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="Dramtic Situations tool" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img31" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Frequently, a Dramatic Situation is both Problem and Scene (usually the climax.). For example: courtroom drama is a case of Supplication, and in <em><span class="s8">To Kill a Mockingbird,</span></em> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Atticus Finch’s defense of Tom Robinson is the Story Problem <em><span class="s8">and </span></em>the courtroom scene (but not the climax.) Basing the central story problem on a Dramatic Situation s is discussed at length in <em><span class="s8">Story Structure Architect</span></em>, by Victoria Schmidt (Writer’s Digest Books, 2005.) And of course any Problem can be thought of as a sequence, a series of scenes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Stories are in a sense recursive: A story’s Story Problem can decompose into a series of Problems, each of which is a smaller story with its own setup, complication, and resolution. In turn, each Problem can be decomposed into a sequence, a series of Scenes, each of which is <em><span class="s8">also </span></em>a little story, typically with setup, complication, and resolution. And in fact, scene outcomes and problem outcomes are often complications for the story problem, with bad endings making things worse for the protagonist.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Mike Figgis suggests a different use for the Dramatic Situations: as an aid when you’re stuck in constructing a plot. Pick one of the 36 situations at random and insert it at the place where you’re stuck. As he puts it, “Chance has always been my friend.”</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s2">Stock Scenes</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Another StoryBuilder tool, Stock Scenes, lists a number of categories of scenes:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="Stock Scenes Categories" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img32" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Each of these categories contains a number of scenes examples:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="Stock Scenes Examples" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img33" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Unlike Dramatic Situations, this tool works just with Scenes. One use is to help develop Master Plot plot points / story beats. For example, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>the Climatic Moments category can suggest Resolution examples, Ticking Clocks can suggest scenes that ratchet up drama, Obstacles to the Chase (or Discovery, or Romance) can be a Pinch Point, and so forth. As with all examples, if you use it, own it, make it yours. Be specific.</p>

<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Using StoryBuilder to Plot Your Story</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s2">Storytelling with Purpose</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">A story is written as a sequence of scenes (in StoryBuilder, Scene story elements.) A scene is a<span class="s21">n event, and the events are causally related: one event causes, and leads to, the next. For example:</span></p>
<p class="ps115"><br /></p>
<p class="ps116">The Queen is told by her mirror that Show White is now the fairest in the land, </p>
<p class="ps116"><strong><span class="s5">so</span></strong> she orders her huntsman to murder Show White and bring her the child’s heart,                     </p>
<p class="ps116"><strong><span class="s5">but</span></strong> Show White pleads for her life, </p>
<p class="ps6">            <strong><span class="s5">so</span></strong> The huntsman spares Show White, abandoning her in the woods,</p>
<p class="ps6">            <strong><span class="s5">and</span></strong> he tricks the Queen by bringing her the heart of a wild boa<span class="s6">r.</span></p>
<p class="ps117"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Coming up with these scenes is an act of imagination- it’s <strong><span class="s5">storytelling</span></strong>, play acting, in which you take on the part of one character and then the other.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">In the previous topic <em><span class="s8">Plotting In Scenes</span></em>, we introduced the idea that every scene must advance the story’s plot: it must move toward the resolution of the story problem it’s a piece of. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This is another way of saying that every scene must have a <strong><span class="s5">purpose</span></strong>: show the Ordinary World, introduce the problem, resolve the conflict. A scene can and usually does have more than one purpose, but <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>must<em><span class="s8"> always</span></em> contribute toward solving the Problem is a part of; otherwise, the story will meander aimlessly. A plotted story must aim toward its outcome as an arrow flies towards its target. Think of each story problem as having structure, of consisting of plot points or story beats. Each plot point is a potential scene, and the plot point’s function is that scene’s purpose.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s2">Scene Count (Story Length)</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">A frequent concern when plotting at the scene level is story length, which can be rephrased as ‘How many scenes do I need?’ As with many writing questions, this one has more than one answer. </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">You can estimate your scene count by dividing your target story (novel, short story, script) word length (or playing time) divided by the average scene word count (or playing time.) If you’re writing a novel and shooting for 100,000-120,000 words, and your scenes average 2,000 words, you’ll need 50-60 scenes. In terms of three-act structure, a quarter of them might go to Act I, a <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>half to Act II, and the remaining quarter to Act III.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s2">Finding Scenes</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">How do you go about finding those 50-60 <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>(or however many you need) scenes?  </p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Don’t think in terms of scene count. Think of plotting as finding the scenes you need to resolve your story’s problems. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If you’ve been following this dialog, you know that you <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>have a top-level problem, the Story Problem, defined on the Story Overview form, and you’ve summarized the problem in its Premise:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><img alt="Plotting with StoryBuilder - Premise" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img6" /></p>
<p class="ps19"> When that problem is resolved, the story is finished. This is the top level design of your story.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">If you were to use Master Plots to create of Scene story elements for the plot points in this problem with the Three Act Structure template, it might look like this:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><img alt="Plotting with StoryBuilder - Story Problem MasterPlots Scene list" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img6" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">This is what plotting the main Story Problem might look like if it were, say, a short story. But it’s longer story (a Novella, in this case), and there aren’t enough scenes to carry the longer work. So instead of thinking of each part as <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>a scene, consider it just as a story beat or plot point. Ignoring the other plot points, consider First Obstacle and Subsequent Obstacles not as Scenes but as Problems= subproblems, Complications, in this case):</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="Plotting with StoryBuilder - Complication SubProblems" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img34" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">In real life one strategy to solve a problem is to decompose it into smaller problems. That same approach works when plotting, the twist being that you’ll be creating rather than solving subproblems. Don’t plot in Scenes; <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>plot in Problems. These problems can be further decomposed into scenes:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="Plotting with StoryBuilder - SubProblems Epanded into Scenes" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img35" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">This process works not only with complications (subplots with bad outcomes which are designed to increase the conflict), but with other subplots. <em><span class="s8">In The Old Man and the Sea,</span></em> Manolin, the boy Santiago mentored and who loves him, has a character arc based on his relationship with the old man:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><img alt="StoryBuilder Manolin Problem" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img6" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">This is an inner problem for Manolin, a coming of age arc, and it’s plotted in just six scenes:</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps23"><img alt="Plotting with StoryBuilder - Manolin Subplot" src="fghyujk_files/Keyboard-Right-Mouse-Key.png" class="img36" /></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">Hemingway uses this problem as a frame around Santiago’s battle, splitting the scenes and using the first three to introduce Santiago before his battle, and the last three to show Manolin vowing to fish with the old man again. Plot your scenes for your Problems, but you don’t have to arrange them in that order in your narrative. That’s what Story Narrator View is for.</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19"><strong><span class="s2">Eliminating Scenes </span></strong></p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps19">A quite different answer to the ‘How many scenes?’ question is ‘As few as possible’, following Robert Heinlein’s adage: “The most important lesson in the writing trade is that any manuscript is improved if you cut away the fat.” Or, if you prefer, William Faulkner’s: “In writing, you must kill your darlings.”</p>
<p class="ps22"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The urge will be to create a scene for every plot point. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But you have a wonderful tool at your disposal, your reader’s imagination. If you can remove a scene and the reader can follow your story line, that thing can and should be cut.</p>

<p class="ps7"><br /></p>

<p class="ps6"><strong><span class="s2">Conflict tab</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps7"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The Conflict tab applies the same GMC (goal, motivation and conflict) approach used in the Problem form at the scene level.</p>
<p class="ps7"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6"><strong><span class="s2">Sequel tab</span></strong></p>
<p class="ps7"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">The scene is the actions your character takes to achieve a goal (and the actions your character’s opponent takes to prevent it.) However, the scene itself <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>(especially if it’s an action scene) may not allow for your characters to react to the events. The Sequel tab is just that, an interlude between this scene and the one that follows to show the emotional response to the (often disastrous) scene, to reflect on it (alone or in dialog), and to come up with a new plan.</p>

<p class="ps13"><span class="s21">The best <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>way to learn about StoryBuilder is to actually create a story with it. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>That's what this tutorial is for. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We'll create a story outline with StoryBuilder and show you exactly what we did at each step along the way.</span></p>
<p class="ps90"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s21">Every story starts with an idea. The idea might come from anywhere. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A conversation might lead to a bit of dialog; someone you see in a crowd could suggest an interesting character; a newspaper article or story you're read or movie you've seen might spark an idea for a conflict. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But regardless of where the idea comes from or how complete it is, at the moment of conception it's all you have, so a good place to start is to capture the idea.</span></p>

<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Why a third character? <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>There's no concrete reason at this point in the concept development, but policemen often work in teams. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Besides, with two detectives, there's someone to talk to. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>At some point in the story we're likely to need to narrate events, to explain what's going on. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>'Buddy' roles are good for that. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>And if we don't need Tony, a touch of the </span><strong><span class="s20">Delete</span></strong><span class="s19"> button can always get rid of him.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">At this point all three characters are stick figures, just names and roles. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But that's okay, we're making progress.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">Next, let's turn our attention to the key piece, the story problems. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The short definition for story is </span><em><span class="s36">trouble</span></em><span class="s19">; without story problems there is no story. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Your early focus in developing the concept should be to identify a specific protagonist with a specific problem.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Clicking on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Problem</span></strong><span class="s19"> entry on the menu bar takes you to the </span><strong><span class="s20">Problem</span></strong><span class="s19"> form, and clicking on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Add</span></strong><span class="s19"> button adds a problem to the story outline:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">2</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">This is a 'cops and robbers' story, and these are often action-oriented. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's stick to that approach; Leonard's basic problem is to catch Charlie. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This defines the</span><span class="s23"> Problem Type</span><span class="s19"> as</span><span class="s34"> Conflict</span><span class="s19"> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>and the</span><span class="s23"> Conflict Type</span><span class="s19"> as</span><span class="s34"> Person vs. Person</span><span class="s19">. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The basic idea for this story was a situation or subject, so we know that, too. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If our original idea had been a character or setting, nailing down the problem subject would be a priority, and the list of</span><span class="s23"> Subject</span><span class="s19"> values could have been useful. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Or we might have started with a</span><span class="s23"> Goal</span><span class="s19"> for the Protagonist and found a</span><span class="s23"> Subject</span><span class="s19"> which interfered with that</span><span class="s23"> Goal</span><span class="s19">.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We can also take a stab at the</span><span class="s23"> Story Question</span><span class="s19">:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">3</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">While the cursor is still on</span><span class="s23"> Story Question</span><span class="s19">, try pressing the [F1] key to see what </span><strong><span class="s20">Help</span></strong><span class="s19"> looks like. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>You can invoke </span><strong><span class="s20">Help</span></strong><span class="s19"> for any control on any form. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">The story problem is still pretty vague. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For one thing, it needs to be a </span><em><span class="s36">difficult</span></em><span class="s19"> problem; if Leonard and Tony go out and arrest Charlie in the first scene, the story's over before it begins. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Charlie has to be hard to catch; we have to make him so. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Focusing on our original idea again, let's say that Charlie is highly mobile, conducting his deals all over town, and that he uses pagers and cellular phones to arrange the deals. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The two detectives' problem, then, is how to overcome this technical advantage.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We can treat this issue of overcoming the advantage of the cellular phones as the major complication, on the way to solving the story problem. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's refine the</span><span class="s23"> Story Question</span><span class="s19"> for this one problem:</span></p>

<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc83"></a><strong><span class="s1">Creating a Story pt 4</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Let's shift gears for a moment and think about outer and inner problems. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The section &#34;Outer and Inner Problems&#34; discusses this topic in detail.  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The outer or external problem we've just added has a physical goal— to catch Charlie Lacas and send him to jail. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>External problems focus attention on physical actions and away from your characters. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>To balance the story with a measure of character orientation, we'll add an inner problem for our protagonist to overcome. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's give Leonard a character flaw to deal with.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Going to the </span><strong><span class="s20">Tools</span></strong><span class="s19"> menu, we select </span><strong><span class="s20">Virtues and Vices</span></strong><span class="s19"> from the </span><strong><span class="s20">Characterization Aids</span></strong><span class="s19"> sub‑ menu and browse through this list of traits until we find one that looks good:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">         </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Remember, we have no preconceptions about Leonard's character; he's a blank sheet of paper. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>He can therefore easily be molded to suit the story, and giving him a character flaw by making him impulsive is a step in that direction.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The </span><strong><span class="s20">Virtues and Vices</span></strong><span class="s19"> tool doesn't update our story outline; it's just a list of traits to review. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Clicking </span><strong><span class="s20">DONE</span></strong><span class="s19"> on the form, we can save this trait in a number of places: on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Habits</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab, on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Role</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab, etc., depending on how he manifests this trait. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">Let's look at one choice, the </span><strong><span class="s20">Inner Traits</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">2</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">This list of traits (which can be tailored to suit your needs) is adapted from psychological personality profiles. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It turns out that Impulsiveness is a value under the</span><span class="s23"> Adventurousness</span><span class="s19"> trait, so we select that value. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We should remember though, that inner traits need to be demonstrated as external actions, under the 'show, don't tell' maxim.  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">This new flaw isn't useful until it affects the story outcome. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>That is, the inner problem needs to have something to do with the outer problem we created earlier. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's add the second problem now. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Recalling that our initial idea mentions rescue, we can let Leonard's impulsive act put him in a situation where he needs rescue:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">3</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">If Leonard's captured, he needs a rescuer, or at least a diversion; Tony's the obvious choice. </span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The story is beginning to take on substance; we can start to visualize some scenes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In fact, if a plot point occurs to you, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>there's no reason not to add it, now or at any time. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Stories are conceived through a process of accumulation, and one of StoryBuilder's strong points is that you can collect whatever pieces fit as you find them. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But before we start plotting let's continue with the problems. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">Character traits are also a means of achieving conflict. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Many stories don't have enough built-in conflict, which leads to contrived plots. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But conflict isn't necessarily limited to the interplay of protagonist and antagonist. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can create conflict by giving Tony a trait which clashes with Leonard's. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The opposite of impulsiveness isn't necessarily caution, though. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Going back to the </span><strong><span class="s20">Inner Traits</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab on Tony's record, we select</span><span class="s34"> Thoughtful</span><span class="s19"> from the</span><span class="s35"> Shrewdness</span><span class="s19"> trait:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">4</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">It's tempting to fill up the screen, by selecting other inner traits at this time, but it's better for the story to focus on just one or two traits in a character.  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">We can clarify the problems further. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The </span><strong><span class="s20">Resolution</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Problem</span></strong><span class="s19"> form identifies the outcome of a problem. The outcome of the story's major outer or external problem is the most important; the story's over when this problem is resolved. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In this case, though, we might solve both problems at once, in a confrontational scene. Let's assume that we want a happy ending, and think about the inner problem's outcome:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">5</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Does this work? <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The story's over when Lacas is captured, and Leonard's inner problem, his impulsiveness, which might have gotten him killed, ends in his rescue. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The question is whether he learns and grows from the experience. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In an action-oriented story, this is less important, so we'll leave it alone for now. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>However, it's worth coming back to; our story's theme will probably have to do with this character flaw (for example, 'Imprudence leads to danger'.)</span></p>
<p class="ps90"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc84"></a><strong><span class="s1">Creating a Story pt 5</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The original external problem is solved at the same time and in the same scene in this story. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This isn't always the case; often the story's turning point is the resolution of the inner problem, and the solution of the outer problem depends on the protagonist's change. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We should state the resolution of the external problem. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Clicking on the first problem from the list at the left of the screen, and then on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Resolution</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab, allows us to key this information:</span></p>

<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">We can visualize a scene in which Lacas walks out of a courtroom, a free man, talking on his cellular phone to someone, and laughing at Leonard. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>That might be a good way to open the story, in fact. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's record it while the idea is fresh.  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Clicking on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Plot</span></strong><span class="s19"> entry on the menu bar takes us to the </span><strong><span class="s20">Plot </span></strong><span class="s19">form, and clicking on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Add</span></strong><span class="s19"> button adds a new item labelled 'Plot Point'. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can key our scene title into the control; when we hit </span><strong><span class="s20">Enter</span></strong><span class="s19"> the 'Plot Point' label will be replaced with the title.</span></p>

<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Of course, one scene isn't a plot. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>While it's premature to worry about plotting before the characters are better defined, let's at least put a skeleton of a plot together.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">On the </span><strong><span class="s20">Tools</span></strong><span class="s19"> menu there's a sub-menu with several tools to assist plotting. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>One of them, </span><strong><span class="s20">Master Plots</span></strong><span class="s19">, would be useful in this situation. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>The master plots available from this sub-menu suggest certain events which take place at different places in a story, and can quickly provide a skeleton plot outline which provides a shape for the plot.</span></p>

<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Let's use the 'Lacas walks out of the courtroom, a free man' scene as our narrative hook. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We'll use the Three Act Play as it was intended, <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>a scaffolding, and replace the plot point for 'Narrative Hook' with our scene. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>To do so, we'll move our scene where it belongs. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>First we double-click on the 'Lacas walks out of the courtroom' label on the list of plot points on the left hand side of the screen.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">1</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">A</span><span class="s23"> Move Pending</span><span class="s19"> label appears in the bottom left hand corner of the screen. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This indicates that the label we double clicked has been marked to be moved. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We then click once on the 'Narrative hook' plot point. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Our scene is moved after it. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If you're moving in a downward direction, the plot point is moved after (below) the target, as in this case. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If you're moving upwards in the list, the plot point will be moved above (before) the target. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>See &#34;Moving plot points&#34; in the &#34;Plotting&#34; chapter <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>for more information.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps122"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">2</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">After we've moved our scene to where we want it, we can get rid of the placeholder by clicking on the 'Narrative hook' plot point once more and then clicking the </span><strong><span class="s20">Delete </span></strong><span class="s19">button.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We also have an idea of what our climax scene is— <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>the showdown we visualized when we were thinking about our problem's resolution. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Clicking on the 'Climax' plot point, change the description to 'Tony diverts Lacas with the phone and wounds him.' <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>The idea is that Tony calls Lacas' phone, which interrupts him.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Plotting is usually the last thing to worry about, for several reasons. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The characters should be well defined, so that their actions are consistent with their natures. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The story problems should also be clearly understood, especially the resolutions. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Every problem is a story in miniature; plotting a story is largely a matter of arranging events from one or more problems into a satisfactory sequence. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But writing is a process of accumulation, and the ideas which you collect to create your story concept can come to you at any time. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If you visualize a plot point, don't hesitate to record it. </span></p>
<p class="ps90"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc86"></a><strong><span class="s1">Creating a Story pt 7</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The characters, so far, have been defined by their roles; the only specific traits we've given them (Leonard and Tony) have been shaped by the story's needs. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It's time to put some flesh on these skeletons.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Let's start with Charlie Lacas. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We know a few things about him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>He's young, he deals drugs, and he uses technology that the detectives don't have. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>That absence of technology suggests that the story doesn't take place in a big city. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But perhaps Charlie is a city boy who's figured out that he can use his supplier contacts in New York to deal drugs in a small city, say in Pennsylvania somewhere. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>It's safer, the competition is less, and he has an edge over the small-town cops. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>This implies that he's fairly bright, which makes him a more worthy adversary for our detectives.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Going to the </span><strong><span class="s20">Character </span></strong><span class="s19">form, we can start creating some of this:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">1</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Details of appearance were created also.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">We then turn to psychological considerations:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">2</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s23">Personality Type</span><span class="s19"> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>is based on the theory of enneagrams (see &#34;Personality Type&#34; under &#34;Psychology Tab&#34; in the &#34;Characters&#34; chapter <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>of this manual for more about enneagrams.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>A stereotype such as this can suggest how the character might react in certain situations.  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">Let's also define some social factors:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">3</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The goal of all of this is to create a fully rounded human being, one who is believable and who you can visualize talking and acting in your story. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The other major consideration is that the character should support the role you've given him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Had the initial story idea been for a character, you might have fleshed the character out before you started looking for story problems, and then looked for a role to fit the character, but in this case the role came first and the character should fit the part.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">We'll look at one last tab, the Back story tab:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">4</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">There's always a question of how much detail to provide, for characters, problems, settings, etc. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The answer will vary from story to story. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For example, this is an action-oriented story, so the characterizations aren't quite as important. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But although not everything you know about the character has to be in the story, everything you know will affect the story as you write it.  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">You can look at the</span><span class="s21"> DANGER.STB</span><span class="s19"> outline on the StoryBuilder default directory to see the rest of the character tabs, and to see the developments of the other two characters.</span></p>
<p class="ps90"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc87"></a><strong><span class="s1">Creating a Story pt 8</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Having developed the characters better, we can look at the plot. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>So far we have a skeleton plot, created with the </span><strong><span class="s20">Master Plots</span></strong><span class="s19"> tool, and have added a couple of specific scenes:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">1</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Our goal is to replace the skeleton plot points with specific scenes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>Of course, you're not bound to follow the skeleton, but our partial goal here is to illustrate StoryBuilder's tools. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We'll write in scenes (see &#34;Plotting in Scenes&#34; for reasons.) <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The opening narrative hook will have introduced the antagonist, Charlie Lacas, so we next need to introduce the detectives. </span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We can do this with a scene of dialog between the two detectives right there in the courtroom.  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s37">Every</span><span class="s19"> <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>scene in the story should have conflict or suspense, and this one is no exception. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Since the scene's between Leonard and Tony, the conflict has to be between them. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We'll let them argue over Lacas walking, and the scene summary becomes 'Leonard and Tony argue over Lacas' verdict.' <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Going to the </span><strong><span class="s20">Conflict</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab, we change the summary and consider the conflict:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">2</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps122"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The </span><strong><span class="s20">Dramatic Situations</span></strong><span class="s19"> form, which is invoked from the </span><strong><span class="s20">Plotting Aids</span></strong><span class="s19"> sub-menu of the </span><strong><span class="s20">Tools</span></strong><span class="s19"> menu, might have also been of use in finding conflict for this scene. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>The shortcut keys [Ctrl+D] bring the form up:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">3</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">It takes some imagination to see how the dramatic situations can fit to a scene, but once you get the hang of it you'll see these same 36 situations repeated endlessly in fiction. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>In this case, we've chosen Fatal Imprudence. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of this scene is to introduce the characters Leonard and Tony, and this dramatic situation allows us to show Leonard's character flaw, as well as to create conflict. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19"> The </span><strong><span class="s20">Copy</span></strong><span class="s19"> button copied roles from the dramatic situation into our </span><strong><span class="s20">Scene</span></strong><span class="s19"> tab. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can assign these two roles to two of our characters (the choices are obvious):</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">4</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The next point in the skeleton is 'Present Problem to be Solved'. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>Since we've worked over the problems, we know what the problem is— the Story Question for our first, external problem: 'How can Leonard and Tony overcome the 'cellular phone advantage' and find out where Charlie Lacas' next drug deal will be held, so that they can catch him?'</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">All we need to do is to change the skeleton plot point into one which presents this problem. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can let Leonard present it to the reader, by discussing Lacas' use of technology:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">5</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">To illustrate the universality of the </span><strong><span class="s20">Dramatic Situations</span></strong><span class="s19"> tool, we chose a dramatic situation for this scene, as well: Enigma.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We also got rid of the first two placeholder plot points by clicking on them on the outline side of the form and then clicking on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Delete</span></strong><span class="s19"> command button.</span></p>
<p class="ps90"><br /></p>
<h1 class="ps2"><a id="doc88"></a><strong><span class="s1">Creating a Story pt 9</span></strong></h1>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We know how our story starts and how it ends; we're left with the middle story that ties these two parts together.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We need to figure out how the two detectives can find out where the next drug deal is to be held. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>One way is to enlist an ally who knows all about wireless communications. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's say he's the owner of a small radio-electronics shop. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But as with the interplay between Leonard and Tony, we need conflict. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's make this character a reluctant ally, one who's coerced into helping our protagonists. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We might make him a petty criminal of some sort, for instance, and have Leonard threaten or blackmail him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>That fits Leonard's character as we know it: he'll go to any lengths to catch Lacas. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's call our new character Joe Edwards. For his crime, we need something serious enough to get him into trouble, but not too serious, or the reader will be outraged that Leonard's left him on the street. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's say that he's used his electronics skills to bug the people in the apartment where he lives; <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>and in particular, the single woman who lives downstairs— he's a Peeping Tom. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can also add the scene where Kraskin threatens Edwards with arrest and exposure unless he cooperates.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">1</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We've also gotten rid of the rest of the scaffolding plot points; we know where we're going now and don't need additional directions. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The </span><strong><span class="s20">Dramatic Situations</span></strong><span class="s19"> entry (had we used it) would have been 'Obtaining (through force)'. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The question now turns to what Edwards will provide our detectives to enable them to eavesdrop on Lacas' cellular phone. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>This is the place where some research might be useful, to make the story more believable. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>However, we'll just have Edwards pull out a modified scanner and key Lacas' phone number, which the detectives provide. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>This gizmo will be our detectives' 'listening post' and will let them overhear anything the drug dealer says on the phone. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We'll add a plot point for this, although technically it's a continuation of the preceding scene. </span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19"> </span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">It's vital, when plotting, to keep the readers in mind, and to think about what will keep them turning pages. This particular plot point isn't too dramatic, but it does have appeal to curiosity. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can spice this up further by having Tony remind Lacas of the laws they're breaking.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We've developed two story problems. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The first or external problem is the one we just gave the reader— the setup or first act. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We've also just resolved this problem, by giving the detectives the means to eavesdrop Lacas. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>The second problem, based on Leonard's impulsiveness, has him captured by Lacas, and we'll want the reader to know if Tony can rescue him. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The second problem provides us with a complication, the capture. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We could therefore look at the middle story as a way to leapfrog from the one story problem to the other. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Since a story problem is a sort of story in miniature (so is a scene), plotting will frequently involve working this way; see &#34;Plotting and the Problem form&#34; for more details.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">Let's look for a way to get Leonard captured. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Turning once more to the </span><strong><span class="s20">Tools</span></strong><span class="s19"> menu, we select </span><strong><span class="s20">Stock Scenes</span></strong><span class="s19"> from the </span><strong><span class="s20">Plotting Aids</span></strong><span class="s19"> sub-menu. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Several further choices appear. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Let's look at the </span><strong><span class="s20">Twists and Turns</span></strong><span class="s19"> choice. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19"> This provides us with a number of stock scenes which offer dramatic twists: </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps122"><br /></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">2</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">In this case the first twist listed might help us; our electronics buff ally, Joe Edwards, could be tied to Lacas in some fashion and tip him off that the two detectives are listing in on his call. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space">  </span>Lacas could then set the cops up. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We decide to go with this. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Clicking on the first item in the list, and then on the </span><strong><span class="s20">Copy </span></strong><span class="s19">button, adds this stock scene into our plot outline.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps122"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">3</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We can change the scene summary to read 'Edwards has tipped Lacas, who traps Kraskin.'  </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">There's something missing, a piece in which the detectives overhear the Charlie Lacas setting up a drug deal, and which leads Leonard to rush impulsively into the ambush. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>But why would Leonard rush to catch Lacas and leave his partner behind?</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We know that our detectives are using an illegal bug to catch Lacas, so they can't implicate their boss or other cops in their quest. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>It's just the two of them. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The two of them might have decided to take turns on an unoffical stake out. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>That way we can have Leonard working the stake out when the deal goes down.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">So let's add a plot point immediately prior to this where this takes place, and title it 'Leonard, on stake out, learns of a drug deal .' <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can add notes to explain the details of the stake out.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">Our plot outline now looks like this:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">4</span></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">This is a relatively complete plot. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We could sit down and start writing the story now, but that would be a mistake. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>There's a lot left unfinished: we haven't created settings, the characters are still unrefined, etc. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The more these things are worked out, the richer and more complete the first draft will be when you write it. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">We should evaluate our work so far. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The creation of the story outline is an excellent time to review and revise. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For one thing, changes at this point in the story's development, while it's still just an outline, are relatively cheap and easy; you're not sacrificing prose and dialog that took time and effort to produce. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>There's also another advantage: at this point you're looking only at the structure of the story. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Every story has these components of problems, characters, setting and plot; but once you begin to write, the bones will be fleshed out in narrative and dialog and dressed with your writing style. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The naked structure will be, in a sense, hidden by the prose. This makes spotting and correcting structural problems more difficult. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps59"><span class="s19">StoryBuilder offers a tool, </span><strong><span class="s20">Key Questions</span></strong><span class="s19">, to assist in refining and testing your story elements. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>There are questions for Story, Problem, Character, Setting, and Plot. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>From the </span><strong><span class="s20">Tools </span></strong><span class="s19">menu, select </span><strong><span class="s20">Key Questions </span></strong><span class="s19">and then </span><strong><span class="s20">Story Questions</span></strong><span class="s19">. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A form displaying a series of questions for the overall story will appear. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We can test the story concept against these questions. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If one is worth further study, notes can be recorded in the</span><span class="s23"> Answer</span><span class="s19"> section. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>For example, scrolling through the questions, we find:</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps89"><br /></p>
<p class="ps27"><span class="s6">5</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">The second part of the question is a good one; we haven't selected a market, and therefore don't know if the story will match slant, length requirements, etc.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">It's a good idea to use </span><strong><span class="s20">Key Questions </span></strong><span class="s19">frequently while creating the concept, and to review them before going on to the draft.</span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">In this tutorial we've produced most of a story outline. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>We've worked through problem refinement, created several characters, drafted a plot, and along the way we've examined several tools to help these processes. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The story outline was created as this tutorial was being written, exactly as shown. We feel that </span><span class="s37">any</span><span class="s19"> story idea can be converted into a fully developed concept using these techniques. </span></p>
<p class="ps28"><br /></p>
<p class="ps13"><span class="s19">&#34;Danger Call&#34; <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>is a action-oriented suspense tale and stresses plot over character development. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>A character-driven story would be developed in much the same way, but the character profiles and relationships would, of course, developed more fully before developing the plot.</span></p>

The trick is to develop an effective workflow, one that gets you to the writing as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Before, during, and after </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">If you find yourself solidly in the pantsers’ camp, here are some techniques and tricks <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>to ‘outline as little as possible’. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">You can use StoryBuilder before, during, and after you’ve started writing.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">If you’re ready to start writing, take a moment and brainstorm a list of scenes. You almost certainly have some in mind. At the start the list doesn’t <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>have to be exhaustive; it’s unlikely it will be. You can add a scene with<span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span> nothing more a title and perhaps a line or two of Scene Sketch. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>If you’ve jumped in and started writing, add the scenes you’ve written. You can always add detail on scenes, most of it on the Scene tab: the setting, who’s in the scene, and a <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>sketch of what happens. You can also use the Stock Scenes tool to find possible scenes to add to your collection.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">But- and this is important- figure out which problem(s) the scenes belong to, and outline the problems. Do this as early as possible. Using any story structuring approach with these problems will suggest what scenes you’re missing and what you might want to write next. If a scene doesn’t fit into one of your story’s problems, it probably doesn’t belong in your story.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">If you’re character oriented, outline the characters you’re visualizing. Details can help bring your characters into focus. Pay attention to their flaws, relationships, and traits- the attributes that lead to conflict. A story is a character with a problem; just as if you had started with scenes, you want to get to (and outline) that problem. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Your character’s problem will often be a character arc- an <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>internal problem involving learning, growing or changing. Unfortunately, that’s usually not the story problem, except for Ascent/Descent plots such as <em><span class="s8">Citizen Kane</span></em> and <em><span class="s8">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</span></em>. The story problem’s goal should be tangible, easy to understand and grasp- usually an external problem. Think of the internal problem as an obstacle that needs to be overcome in order to solve the external problem, by seeing the flaw that’s at the heart of it and changing a behavior or problem-solving approach which affects the story problem. If you start with a character flaw, find a problem that correcting it can solve. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>

<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">After the First Draft</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Outlining after you already have a first draft sounds a bit crazy, but it’s not. A novel is a long journey, and long journeys to unknown destinations frequently lead to an occasional wrong turn. If you have a map to check, you can easily see where you went astray. An outline is that map. </p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">In StoryBuilder, Problem, and particular the Story Problem, is key. Start by adding your scenes, and then, as described in ‘StoryBuilder for Pantsers’, find your problems from them. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>The outline doesn’t have to be detailed,<em><span class="s8"> except for the Problems</span></em>. You want to thoroughly understand your Problem story elements.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Using your outline as your guide gives you a number of places to start editing- and every story needs editing. With StoryBuilder you’re editing for story (structural edits) as opposed to line or copy editing. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>Key Questions, for Problem and Character and Scene, will ask about specific issues. Does your protagonist have a clear story goal? Do the scenes show her actively trying to achieve it, despite opposition? Does the Story Problem have a clear resolution, and does your story end when it’s resolved? Do problems other than the main story problem connect to the story problem? (A clue to this, and a plotting plus, is a scene which contributes to both problems’ structure.) Does your protagonist grow or change (does she have an internal problem and thus a character arc?)</p>

<h2 class="ps4"><strong><span class="s2">Critiquing with StoryBuilder</span></strong></h2>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Although StoryBuilder’s made to help you outline your own stories, it has another use: as an aid to understanding others’ stories. StoryBuilder’s ancestor, the original StoryBuilder, started as just such a tool.</p>
<p class="ps5"><br /></p>
<p class="ps6">Critiquing others’ stories is a great way to improve your art, because it’s often difficult to see your own stories with the distance needed to find their structural flaws and correct them. </p>
