Story Elements <br/>
 <br/>
Your outline is a tree of Story Elements which are displayed in the Navigation Pane. Clicking (or touching) a Story Element node on the Navigation Pane will display that Story Element’s  content in the Content Pane. <br/>
Here, clicking on the first or root node in the tree displays the Story  Overview  Form.  <br/>
 <br/>
On some screen sizes and orientations the Navigation and Content panes may be stacked with the Navigation pane above the Content pane. In those cases the Show/Hide Navigation button (the hamburger menu button) acts differently; it toggles from the Navigation Pane to the Content Pane and back. <br/>

 <br/>
Every Story Element type is a different form. These are the story elements: <br/>
 <br/>
	•	Story Overview  <br/>
	•	Problem <br/>
	•	Character <br/>
	•	Setting <br/>
	•	Scene <br/>
	•	Folder <br/>
	•	Section <br/>
 <br/>
Your outline has only one Story Overview; it’s created automatically when you open or create a new outline. The Story Overview is the root of the Navigation  Pane tree, and all other Story Elements are below it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Every form has a full-page tab (labeled Notes) which holds your general notes and thoughts regarding the story element.  <br/>
