# StoryCAD Test Manual

This repo is a staging repo for the real StoryCAD Manual stored in the StoryCAD Repo.

# Development
The test manual is live at: https://storybuilder-org.github.io/StoryBuilder-Manual/
You can edit it at using the built-in GitHub Editor or locally using a Markdown Editor (We recomend VS Code with a Markdown Editor)

The StoryCAD manual uses the [Just The Docs template](https://just-the-docs.com/) and can be ran locally for testing.

# Making changes to the StoryCAD Manual
All changes to the live manual must first be tested here, after which they can be moved to the live StoryCAD manual in the StoryCAD repo.
