 Relationships Tab <br/>

![](Character-Relationships-Tab.png)


The Relationship tab on the Character form describes significant character-to-character relationships. <br/>

Relationships are made when two people with a different set of values and often varying personalities come together. Relationships in fiction  can be a source of conflict. <br/>
Most stories involve interactions between characters: adversarial, social, familial, romantic. A character in a relationship is distinct from a character as an individual; the relationship is a dynamic. Characters in a relationship behave differently when theyâ€™re together- a sort of role. <br/>

This tab is only one half  of the relationship; go to the Relation character  to define  the other half. Be aware that relationships seldom have the same dynamic. <br/>
