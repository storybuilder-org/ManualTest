### Critiquing with StoryBuilder ###
Critiquing with StoryBuilder <br/>

Although StoryBuilder’s made to help you outline your own stories, it has another use: as an aid to understanding others’ stories. StoryBuilder’s ancestor, the original StoryBuilder, started as just such a tool. <br/>

Critiquing others’ stories is a great way to improve your art, because it’s often difficult to see your own stories with the distance needed to find their structural flaws and correct them.  <br/>
