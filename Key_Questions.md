Key Questions are accessible from the Tools menu.  There are sub-menus which contain lists of questions appropriate to the Story, Problem, Character, Setting, and Plot forms and story elements. <br/>
 <br/>
Use the key questions to refine and test your story elements.   If you wish, you can record  answers or notes to questions that need highlighting or require more thought.  These answers will be saved with your story folder and displayed when you invoke Key Questions in later outlining sessions, and can also be printed. <br/>
 <br/>
The questions for a story element are a circular list.  That is, when you've displayed the last question for this form, the next question to display will be the first question for the form.  To navigate through the questions, use the Next (>>) and Previous (<<) buttons. <br/>
