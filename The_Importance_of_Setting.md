The Importance of Setting <br/>
 <br/>
Setting often receives less attention than other story elements such as Problem and Character, and it does in this document as well. <br/>
 <br/>
But setting is more than just the backdrop of the story; plot and character are shaped and limited by the choice of setting.  Settings: <br/>
 <br/>
	•	Provide much of the verisimilitude of the story, making it real and believable to the reader. <br/>
 <br/>
	•	Provide excitement and color.  Much of the joy of fiction is to allow the reader to travel to other times, other places, and even other worlds. <br/>
 <br/>
	•	Establish mood and tone. <br/>
 <br/>
	•	Provide a source of symbolism and meaning for the story. <br/>

 <br/>
A Scene’s settings ties characters and their actions together.  Generally, unless you unite your protagonist and antagonist at one place and time, there is no conflict.   <br/>
 <br/>
Confined settings increase dramatic tension: for example, Murder on the Orient Express, or Titanic.  Setting also establishes the framework of beliefs and scope of action which some characters are more comfortable in.  A cowboy belongs in a western setting in ways that a ballet dancer or biochemist don't.  But placing characters in unusual settings can create or increase drama. <br/>
